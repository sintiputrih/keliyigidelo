The remaining of the writing is about Fielder, his age job, and life with Hunter.</p><h3><strong>Meet Fielder Jewett, Actor Hunter Doohan’s Husband</strong></h3><p>On 18 June 2022, Hunter Doohan took to his Instagram several glimpses of him getting married to his beloved Fielder Jewett. In the caption, he simply wrote that it is hard trying to sum up their wedding day in an Instagram caption. Then, he gushed that it was “absolutely” the best day of their lives. Of course, he also cared to thank everyone who made everything so special.</p><p>Before this, the pair got engaged during the 2020 Covid lockdown. It was more of a quarantine engagement with just the two of them and their cat resent. About this, Hunter took to his Instagram a picture of him getting down on one knee on 31 December 2020. In the caption, joyously wrote, “Is there anything more 2020 than an at-home proposal? I love you @fielderjewett! Can’t wait to marry you!”. Yes, this exchange happened in their own apartment with the both of them dressed very casually, in hoodies and trousers.</p><p>The twosome has been together since at least September 2019.</p><h3><strong>Fielder Jewett Age</strong></h3><p>Fielder Jewett was born in 1988. So, he reached the age of 33 in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Fielder Jewett Job</strong></h3><p>On Twitter, Fielder Jewett mentioned being a <span>writer, swimmer, home brewer, and hobbyist. But, this is not all.</span></p><p>All of his career details have been listed on his LinkedIn profile which we shall talk about now.</p><p>In August 2021, Fielder got himself enrolled in a Juris Doctor (JD) degree at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</p><p>He also hinted that it is all he has been focusing on lately. For this, he even stopped doing his freelance job as a producer. Between January 2017 and August 2021, Fielder served as an associate producer on independent features Imperial Dreams, Bleeding Heart, Mailman, and All the Wilderness. He further Served as co-producer on Rosy and The Vanishing of Sidney Hall. In all roles, he claims that he managed day-to-day production from beginning to end, overseeing crew hiring, set logistics, and delivery minutiae.</p>So far in this journey, Fielder is believed to have amassed an estimated $300K net worth by 2022.<h3><strong>Is Fielder Jewett On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes.

You may give this ever-supportive, loving, and caring patriarch a follow on his Instagram <a href=#>@garrettjewett</a>. Here, he has routinely documented his life in an incredible way. But then, he also regularly featured on his son’s social media.</p><p>Maybe Fielder’s mother also did show up on Fielder’s social media. Her name is Doris Downes. Reportedly born in 1961, she is 61 years old in 2022. Dorris was raised in&nbsp;Fredericksburg, Virginia.
