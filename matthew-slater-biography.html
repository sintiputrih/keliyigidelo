He furthered his education at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/21111213/slater_matt_1280-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matthew Slater career</h2><p>The New England Patriots moved up with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to choose Slater in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft, 153rd overall.</p><p>Son of an NFL Hall of Fame member, Slater was one of two players taken in the 2008 Draft (the other being Chris Long), and the sixth overall in the history of the NFL Draft. In his rookie season of 2008, Slater participated in 14 games, earning 12 special teams tackles and returning 11 kickoffs for 155 yards.</p><p>Slater played in 14 games during the 2009 season for the Patriots, making six tackles on special teams and one six-yard sprint as a wide receiver.</p><p>In addition, he averaged 24.5 yards returning 11 kickoffs for 269 yards. In the final game of the regular season, Slater returned kickoffs for a career-long 35 yards against the Houston Texans.</p><p>In the postseason game against the Baltimore Ravens, he also appeared on special teams coverage units and as a reserve wide receiver. Slater recorded two kickoff returns for 46 yards and a special teams tackle during the match.</p><p>Slater did not return any kicks or punt returns in 2010 and did not log any offensive or defensive stats. With 21 special teams tackles in 15 games, he did, however, lead the club.</p><p>Slater was chosen by his teammates to serve as the special teams captain for the 2011 campaign. With 17 regular season special teams tackles, Slater led the Patriots and carved up a reputation for himself as a force on special teams.</p><p>But during the season, he was present in all three phases. Slater set up the team for the Patriots’ first score of the season in the season opener against the Miami Dolphins by receiving a 46-yard pass from Tom Brady (his sole career reception). It was Slater’s first major play of the season.</p><p>As a special team member, Slater was chosen for the 2012 Pro Bowl and the 2011 Pro Football Writers Association (PFW/PFWA) All-Pro teams, which included the All-NFL and All-AFC.</p><p>After the 2011 season, Slater was a free agent and returned to the Patriots in 2012. He inked a three-year deal. He was elected to serve as the team’s player representative to the NFL Players Association in addition to being re-elected as Special Teams Captain.</p><p>For the second consecutive season, Slater was also selected to the Pro Bowl and the 2012 PFW/PFWA All-Pro, winning the only spot on the AFC special team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/21111157/matthew-slater-leaves-field-at-gillette-stadium-patriots-jets-2023-nfl-week-18-football-659b1b923e756-1024x576.jpg><p>Slater is in his sixth season as a Patriot, and he is still a dependable captain and motivating leader both on and off the field. Despite missing four games early in the season due to injury, he finished with the second-most special teams tackles during the regular season 14 on the club. It was Slater’s on-field exploits that earned him a third consecutive Pro Bowl selection.</p><p>Slater reportedly inked a two-year contract extension on November 26, 2014, meaning he would play for the Patriots through the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Once more, Slater was selected to the Pro Bowl as a special teams player and as an All-Pro. It was his third All-Pro selection and fourth consecutive Pro Bowl selection. In Super Bowl XLIX, Slater received a Super Bowl ring as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–24.</p><p>In 2015, Slater was again an excellent member of the special teams. He was selected for his fifth Pro Bowl while playing special teams. At the time, the Slaters were the second-most-nominated father-son team in the NFL, behind only Archie and Peyton Manning, with 13 nominations between them. Slater’s father is a seven-time Pro Bowler.</p><p>Slater signed a one-year contract extension with the Patriots through 2017 on August 31, 2016. Due to a hamstring injury, he missed the first four games of 2017 because of it.</p><p>Slater re-signed with the Patriots on a two-year deal on March 20, 2018. In Super Bowl LIII, Slater’s third Super Bowl victory came as the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13-3.</p><p>On an 11-yard blocked punt return in Week 4, Slater scored his first NFL touchdown and the team defeated the Buffalo Bills 16–10. He broke Steve Tasker’s record for the most special teams Pro Bowl awards in NFL history by being selected to his eighth Pro Bowl.</p><p>Slater and the Patriots agreed to a two-year contract extension on March 13, 2020. After placekicker Stephen Gostkowski was cut and quarterback Tom Brady left the team, Slater became the Patriots’ longest-serving player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/21111137/uknx1howhm65m8j8lz5o.jpg><p>He set an NFL record with nine choices for special teams Pro Bowls when he was named to the 2020 Pro Bowl on December 21, 2020. For the second straight season in 2021, Slater excelled on special teams.</p><p>Slater and the Patriots agreed to a one-year contract extension on March 14, 2022. He took part in all 17 matches. Throughout the season, he was involved in most of the special teams snaps.</p><p>On February 17, 2023, Slater signed a new one-year contract extension. Slater was the best in the special teams department, according to Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, when he was asked which player was the best at each aspect of the game. He declared his retirement from football on February 20, 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matthew Slater family and siblings</h2><p>Slater was born to Annie Slater and Jackie Slater.
