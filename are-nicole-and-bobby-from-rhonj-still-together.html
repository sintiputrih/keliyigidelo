Since leaving the show, she has kept a relatively low profile and does not have an Instagram to keep viewers updated. As for her dating life, it seems to be nonexistent or extremely private.</p><p>Then Why did Dina leave RHONJ again? By season 2, Dina opted to leave <b>due to personal reasons that stemmed from the family drama with her sister and sister-in-law</b>. She returned in season 6, but only to exit again after one season. At her last reunion show, Dina told Andy that reality TV just wasn’t for her.</p><p>Is Amber and Jim still together?</p><p>Amber Marchese</p><p>While the duo fought about Jim’s drinking and Amber admitted she had an affair with another woman, <b>the twosome are still together as of November 2018</b> and raising their two young kids, Isabella and Corbin.</p><p>Subsequently, Is Nicole Napolitano married?

She has since announced that she will never return to the show again.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_to_Nicole_and_Teresa_from_RHONJ></span><strong>What happened to Nicole and Teresa from RHONJ?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicole Napolitano and twin sister Teresa Aprea joined the show in season six, but only lasted for a season. The twins returned in a guest capacity in season six, but they haven’t been seen on the show since. Nicole and Teresa went on to host a podcast titled Girls in Heels.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_did_Rino_cheat_with_on_RHONJ></span><strong>Who did Rino cheat with on RHONJ?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The big rumor flying around this season is that Teresa’s husband Rino slept with her mother, Santa, leading to their divorce (the pair has since remarried).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_does_the_cast_of_RHONJ_live></span><strong>Where does the cast of RHONJ live?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple first listed their 9,100-ft. Montville, N.J. mansion in 2012, but it wasn’t until late 2020 that they closed a deal. Since then, the couple bought a new home in Franklin Lakes, N.J, where they plan to raise their three children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Teresa%E2%80%99s_mom_died></span><strong>How did Teresa’s mom died?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Teresa often pays tribute to her late parents on social media. Her father, Giacinto Gorga, passed away this past April at age 76, from chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease and heart problems, and her mother, Antonia, passed away at age 66 from pneumonia in March 2017.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_Siggy_RHONJ></span><strong>What happened Siggy RHONJ?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In August of 2021, Siggy left reality TV, and she also left New Jersey behind for a sunny spot in Florida. During the 2020 presidential election, RHONJ fans learned that Siggy was a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Jacqueline_and_Teresa_still_friends></span><strong>Are Jacqueline and Teresa still friends?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The duo were a real friendship, going back years, and it was such a shame to see all of that fall and crumble before our eyes. Whilst the two have attempted to reconcile back in season 7, it didn’t last. But it seems Andy Cohen like many of us are still rooting for the two of them to get back together.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Rino_sleep_with_Teresa%E2%80%99s_mum></span><strong>Did Rino sleep with Teresa’s mum?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After last night’s episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey revealed claims that Teresa Aprea’s husband, Rino, cheated on her with her mother, Santa, a RHONJ insider tells Radar, “It’s true” — and it happened “more than once!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_owns_Ponte_Vecchio_Brooklyn></span><strong>Who owns Ponte Vecchio Brooklyn?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rino is the owner-operator of two landmark NYC restaurants.

One person whose time on the show was short-lived is Amber Marchese. She spent one season on the show and had many arguments with co-stars, later calling out Teresa Giudice.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Teresa%E2%80%99s_mom_pass_away_while_she_was_in_jail></span><strong>Did Teresa’s mom pass away while she was in jail?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Giudice has talked at length on the Bravo show about how she resented the fact that she spent 11 months at the end of her mother’s life in prison for fraud, while ex-husband Joe Giudice was serving time when Gorga passed. “It was one of the worst times in my life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Joe_Giudice_now></span><strong>Where is Joe Giudice now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The businessman moved to the Bahamas shortly after he was deported to Italy in 2019 after serving prison time for fraud. Since his deportation, Giudice has been determined to move back to the U.S. to reunite with his family, recently hiring a new attorney to fight his deportation case.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_filed_for_divorce_on_RHONJ></span><strong>Who filed for divorce on RHONJ?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>REAL Housewives of New Jersey newbie Caroline Rauseo is divorcing her construction company owner husband Francesco. Caroline, 49, is joining the upcoming season of RHONJ alongside friend Teresa Giudice and co-stars Jennifer Aydin, Melissa Gorga, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs, and Jackie Goldschneider.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Siggy_Flicker%E2%80%99s_husband_do></span><strong>What does Siggy Flicker’s husband do?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the moment, Campanella owns a successful car dealership, which is how he has earned his money. According to his LinkedIn page, Campanella owns Bayside Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in Bayside, Queens.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_got_fired_from_RHONJ></span><strong>Who got fired from RHONJ?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Queens of Bravo, Jackie Goldschneider has been demoted from a full-time housewife to just a “friend of.” She had been a main cast member on RHONJ for seasons 9 through 12. As her role on the reality series has been lessened, the search for new women to take her spot has begun.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Jacqueline_Laurita%E2%80%99s_daughter_still_married></span><strong>Is Jacqueline Laurita’s daughter still married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ashlee and Pete tied the knot on Aug. 8, 2018, almost two years after they welcomed their son, Cameron Hendrix Malleo, now 5, on Aug. 31, 2016. But nearly two years after that, Ashlee announced in July 2020 that the couple had separated.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Melissa_still_talk_to_Caroline></span><strong>Does Melissa still talk to Caroline?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sadly, it doesn’t look like Melissa was able to keep her budding friendship with Caroline, especially after pledging loyalty to Teresa. Caroline, in the end, chose to leave the franchise instead of causing more turmoil within the family. Both have always spoken highly of one another and seemed to leave on good terms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Real_Housewives_of_New_Jersey_fake></span><strong>Is Real Housewives of New Jersey fake?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Real Housewives of New Jersey is one of the most authentic series in the franchise. For a long time, it was actually hard for me to watch because of the family drama. While a lot of the Housewives shows are based on contracts friendships (using that word loosely), RHONJ has always been more family-oriented.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_RHONJ_staged></span><strong>Is RHONJ staged?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“It’s never scripted, but they try to push you. ‘Hey, by the way, did you hear this? ‘ and if you’re dumb enough to believe it, you’re going to give them what they want,” the former reality star, 59, said. “It’s like playing in the schoolyard and you see the bully grabbing the quarter out of the kid’s pocket.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happened_amber_RHONJ></span><strong>What happened amber RHONJ?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After surviving a battle with breast cancer in 2009, Amber revealed in September 2016 that her cancer had returned, but she finished treatment and was back in the clear. Months earlier, the former Bravo star also revealed she was diagnosed with Lyme disease.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Luis_Ruelas></span><strong>Who is Luis Ruelas?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Teresa Giudice’s fiancé, Luis Ruelas, has a history of being in legal hot water. Several people have sued the NJ-based businessman and his company, Digital Media Solutions, over allegedly illegal practices.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Teresa_Giudice_tattoo></span>What is Teresa Giudice tattoo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Teresa got the words “Sempre Insieme” inked on her ribcage by tattoo artist Ashley Hsiung. The Italian phrase translates to “always together.” Her tattoo reveal comes just a few days after the 4-year anniversary of her mother, Antonia Gorga’s, passing.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_Joe_Giudice_visit_the_United_States></span><strong>Can Joe Giudice visit the United States?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He confirmed that his lawyer “is filing a waiver of inadmissibility.” According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website, the waiver will “allow certain inadmissible foreign nationals to enter the United States temporarily as nonimmigrants.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_did_Melissa_and_Joe_move_to></span><strong>Where did Melissa and Joe move to?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Melissa Gorga and her husband Joe Gorga have moved into a $950,000 home in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey as they attempt to sell three of their other properties in The Garden State.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1krrOxjKegnKecmnqiusNmmaiakq56p77OpmSroJ%2Bjt26%2F06KjpWWkpLSmwMeeqWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-nicole-and-bobby-from-rhonj-still-together.html&text=Are%20Nicole%20and%20Bobby%20from%20RHONJ%20still%20together%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-nicole-and-bobby-from-rhonj-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-nicole-and-bobby-from-rhonj-still-together.html&title=Are%20Nicole%20and%20Bobby%20from%20RHONJ%20still%20together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-nicole-and-bobby-from-rhonj-still-together.html&title=Are%20Nicole%20and%20Bobby%20from%20RHONJ%20still%20together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-nicole-and-bobby-from-rhonj-still-together.html&title=Are%20Nicole%20and%20Bobby%20from%20RHONJ%20still%20together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-nicole-and-bobby-from-rhonj-still-together.html&description=Are%20Nicole%20and%20Bobby%20from%20RHONJ%20still%20together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./carley-shimkus-career-earnings-what-is-her-salary-net-worth-411989-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carley Shimkus Career Earnings  What Is Her Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-polly-cameron-shaun-dooley-wife-682399-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Polly Cameron, Shaun Dooley Wife?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
