The remark means that <b>the lender extending the credit to you closed the account, and not you the consumer</b>. The remark doesn’t directly affect your credit, but future creditors might not like to see it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-reported-by-grantor-mean></span>What does Reported by grantor mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“<b>Closed by grantor</b>” can appear on your credit report when your credit card issuer closed your credit card as opposed to when you have closed your own account. Your credit card issuer may close your account for variety of reasons including: You fell behind on credit card payments, … The credit card issuer is liquidating.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-get-rid-of-canceled-by-credit-grantor></span>How do I get rid of canceled by credit grantor?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>As long as they stay on your credit report, closed accounts can continue to impact your credit score. If you’d like to remove a closed account from your credit report, you can <b>contact the credit bureaus</b> to remove inaccurate information, ask the creditor to remove it or just wait it out.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-closed-accounts-mean-on-my-credit-report></span>What does closed accounts mean on my credit report?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What does ‘account closed’ mean on a credit report? If you have closed credit card accounts, your credit report will indicate <b>whether the account was closed by you or by the account issuer</b>. … The account issuer might close one because of default, late payments or inactivity.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-bad-when-a-creditor-closes-your-account></span>Is it bad when a creditor closes your account?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Having a card account closed by the issuer can hurt your credit scores</b>. Use your cards regularly to avoid it. If you don’t use a credit card for a year or more, the issuer may decide to close the account. In fact, inactivity is one of the most common reasons for account cancellations.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-i-still-owe-money-on-a-closed-account></span>Do I still owe money on a closed account?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The primary cardholder is still liable for any remaining balance of a closed</b> credit account. However, if you were seriously delinquent on the account and the credit card issuer sold the balance to a third-party collection agency, you now owe the third-party debt collector.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-charge-off-as-bad-debt-profit-and-loss-write-off-mean></span>What does charge-off as bad debt profit and loss Write off mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A charge-off occurs when you don’t pay the full minimum payment on a debt for several months and your creditor writes it off as a bad debt. Basically, it means <b>the company has given up hope that you’ll pay back the money you borrowed and considers the debt a loss on their</b> profit-and-loss statement.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-does-it-take-for-something-to-come-off-your-credit-report-after-you-pay-it-off></span>How long does it take for something to come off your credit report after you pay it off?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>seven years Any collection entries related to the same original debt will disappear from your credit report <b>seven years from the date</b> of the first missed payment that led up to the charge-off.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-closed-account-to-be-removed-from-credit-report></span>How long does it take for a closed account to be removed from credit report?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>7 years Also, remember that closed accounts on your report will eventually disappear on their own. Negative information on your reports is removed after <b>7 years</b>, whereas accounts closed in good standing will disappear from your report after 10 years.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-charge-offs-go-away-after-7-years></span>Do charge offs go away after 7 years?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>A charge-off stays on your credit report for seven years after the date the account in question first went delinquent</b>. (If the charge-off first appears after six months of delinquency, it will remain on your credit report for six and a half years.)<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-609-letter></span>What is a 609 letter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A 609 Dispute Letter is often billed as <b>a credit repair secret or legal loophole that forces</b> the credit reporting agencies to remove certain negative information from your credit reports. And if you’re willing, you can spend big bucks on templates for these magical dispute letters.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-you-should-never-pay-a-collection-agency></span>Why you should never pay a collection agency?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>On the other hand, paying an outstanding loan to a debt collection agency can hurt your credit score. … Any action on your credit report can negatively impact your credit score – even paying back loans. If you <b>have an outstanding loan that’s a year</b> or two old, it’s better for your credit report to avoid paying it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-a-closed-account-still-reporting></span>Why is a closed account still reporting?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When you pay off and close an account, <b>the creditor will update the account information to show that the account has been closed and that there is no longer a balance owed</b>. … For that reason, even closed accounts with a $0 balance will remain on your credit report for a period of time.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-623-dispute-letter></span>What is a 623 dispute letter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The name 623 dispute method refers to section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The method <b>allows you to dispute a debt directly with the creditor in question as long as</b> you have already filed your complaint with the credit bureau and completed their process.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-604-letter></span>What is a 604 letter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A 604 dispute letter <b>asks credit bureaus to remove errors from your report that fall under</b> section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). While it might take some time, it’s a viable option to protect your credit and improve your score.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-611-letter></span>What is a 611 letter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Here’s what you need to know: The Fair Credit Reporting Act’s (FCRA) Section 611 <b>allows for consumers to challenge questionable items on their credit reports</b>. This includes late payments charge-offs, collections, tax liens, bankruptcies, judgments, foreclosures, or any personal identification information.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-609-disputes-work></span>Do 609 disputes work?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There’s <b>no evidence to suggest a 609 letter is more or less effective</b> than the usual process of disputing an error on your credit report—it’s just another method of doing so. … Any accurate or verifiable information will stay on your credit report—a 609 letter doesn’t guarantee its removal.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-removing-old-addresses-from-credit-report-help></span>Does removing old addresses from credit report help?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Personal identifying information like names and addresses don’t affect your credit score in any way, so an old address on your credit report <b>won’t have a direct impact on your ability</b> to secure new credit.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-remove-old-addresses-from-my-credit-report></span>How do I remove old addresses from my credit report?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You may also request that the address be removed from your credit report by <b>disputing it with Experian</b>. You can dispute by mail, telephone, or via the Internet. As long as the address is not associated with any of your accounts, Experian can remove it at your request.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-11-word-phrase-in-credit-secrets></span>What is the 11 word phrase in credit secrets?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Try not to let all of the calls badgering you from a debt collector get to you. If you need to take a break, you can use this 11 word phrase to stop debt collectors: “<b>Please cease and desist all calls and contact with me, immediately.</b>” Here is what you should do if you are being contacted by a debt collector.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-i-get-a-charge-off-removed-without-paying></span>How can I get a charge off removed without paying?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If you can’t pay the balance in full, you can try to start negotiations with the creditor.</b><li class=TrT0Xe>Step 1: Determine who owns the debt. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Step 2: Find out details about the debt. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Step 3: Offer a settlement amount. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Step 4: Request a “pay-for-delete” agreement. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Step 5: Get the entire agreement in writing.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMrqWpmZmZeqOty5qlnJ1dp7Kxu9GtnJ1lkah6onnLqKqsZZKueqS%2BxJ2grWWXp66vwM6rZKadkaM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-unpaid-balance-reported-as-a-loss-by-credit-grantor-mean.html&text=What%20does%20unpaid%20balance%20reported%20as%20a%20loss%20by%20credit%20grantor%20mean&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-unpaid-balance-reported-as-a-loss-by-credit-grantor-mean.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-unpaid-balance-reported-as-a-loss-by-credit-grantor-mean.html&title=What%20does%20unpaid%20balance%20reported%20as%20a%20loss%20by%20credit%20grantor%20mean" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-unpaid-balance-reported-as-a-loss-by-credit-grantor-mean.html&title=What%20does%20unpaid%20balance%20reported%20as%20a%20loss%20by%20credit%20grantor%20mean" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-unpaid-balance-reported-as-a-loss-by-credit-grantor-mean.html&title=What%20does%20unpaid%20balance%20reported%20as%20a%20loss%20by%20credit%20grantor%20mean" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-unpaid-balance-reported-as-a-loss-by-credit-grantor-mean.html&description=What%20does%20unpaid%20balance%20reported%20as%20a%20loss%20by%20credit%20grantor%20mean" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./y2k-fashion-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2000s-inspired-trend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Y2K fashion: why everyone is so obsessed with the 2000s-inspired aesthetic this year">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-does-it-mean-that-gods-grace-is-sufficient-2-corinthians-129.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What does it mean that Gods grace is sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9)?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
