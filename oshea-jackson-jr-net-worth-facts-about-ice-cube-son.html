You've seen him in Straight Outta Compton, Long Shot, and Godzilla: King of Monsters. There's artistry running in the blood of his family: Jackson Jr's father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Cube</a>, was a prolific writer of rap troublemaker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NWA</a> and has launched a successful acting career since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilibet Diana & Other Celebrity Kids Named After Family Members</a></span></p><p>However, still, there are many facts fans may not know about Jackson Jr. How is his relationship with Cube? Did they attend the same high school? How did he prepare to play his father in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Straight Outta Compton</a>? To answer everything, here are ten lesser-known facts about the actor.</p><h2 id=o-shea-jackson-jr-s-net-worth-clocks-at-3-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s Net Worth Clocks At $3 Million</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, O'Shea's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> net worth stands at $3 million</a>. While it's still $157 million less than his father's, O'Shea's slow rise to Hollywood stardom could see the number climbing up in a matter of years. Besides Straight Outta Compton, he also starred in Ingrid Goest West and Den of Thieves. He made his TV debut in 2018 in Drunk History by portraying the legendary DJ Kool Herc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-attended-the-same-high-school-as-his-father><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Attended The Same High School As His Father</span></h2><p>O'Shea and Ice Cube both attended William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California.</p><p>"All I can say is, it ain’t Compton," he recalled his childhood. "The stress and turmoil that my father had to go through at a young age to make sure that I didn’t have the same trials and tribulations, I couldn’t be more grateful."</p><h2 id=he-studied-screenwriting-at-the-university-of-southern-california><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Studied&nbsp;Screenwriting At The University Of Southern California</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's safe to say that Straight Outta Compton wasn't just a "family" project. After graduating from Taft High School in 2009, O'Shea soon enrolled in the University of Southern California. He went to the School of Cinematic Arts at the university to get a formal education in screenwriting.</p><p>Speaking of university, his father also pursued higher education at the Phoenix Institute of Technology. However, after obtaining his diploma in architectural drafting, he returned home to take his rapping career more seriously.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Stars From The 2000s Now Have Adult Kids (Here’s What They Look Like)</a></span></p><h2 id=besides-acting-he-is-also-a-rapper><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Besides Acting, He Is Also A Rapper</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You've read that right. O'Shea took OMG as his moniker. He released his mixtape debut, Jackin' for Beats, back in 2012 under his father's Lench Mob independent label. He enlisted Drake's "Forever," Dr. Dre's "Kush," Meek Mill's "House Party," and Waka Flocka Flame's "No Hands" on the 10-track mixtape. DJ Crazy Toons, Cube's official DJ, hosted the 30-minute project.</p><p>Speaking of rap,&nbsp;O'Shea Jackson Jr. is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a big fan of Eminem</a>. He even spoke highly of Em's critically-panned Relapse album and admitted that he has every single one of Em's albums.</p><h2 id=his-brother-also-took-ice-cube-s-rapper-career-path><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Brother Also Took Ice Cube's Rapper Career Path</span></h2><p>O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s brother, Darrell, took Doughboy as his moniker. Interestingly, it's the nickname of a character whom their father played on his screen debut, Boyz n the Hood. He was born in 1992 from the rapper's relationship with his wife, Kimberly Woodruff. While the movie itself "only made $57 million out of a $6.5 million budget," Boyz n the Hood is a certified and timeless hood comedy classic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-featured-on-his-father-s-album><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Was Featured On His Father's Album</span></h2><p>Interestingly, Ice Cube took both of his sons under his label and featured them on two tracks in his I Am the West album, titled "She Couldn't Make It on Her Own" and "Y'all Know How I Am" with Young Maylay. If you don't know who the latter is, Young Maylay is the actor behind Carl "CJ" Johnson, the legendary protagonist of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.</p><h2 id=he-had-to-audition-to-play-his-dad-in-straight-outta-compton><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Had To Audition To Play His Dad In 'Straight Outta Compton'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, despite having Ice Cube as his father, O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s route to Hollywood wasn't an easy one. In addition to his formal degree in screenwriting, he still had to undergo an audition to portray his father in Straight Outta Compton.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake & 9 Other Musicians Who Proudly Showed Off Their Kids On Stage</a></span></p><p>"I knew that people would think I just gave him the job," said his father. "So I wanted him to be more than ready. I wanted him to be a great actor by the time we started to shoot."</p><h2 id=khlo-kardashian-was-once-crazy-over-him><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Khloé Kardashian Was Once 'Crazy' Over Him</span></h2><p>As he shot to stardom after Straight Outta Compton, O'Shea Jackson Jr. found new popularity with the ladies including <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloé Kardashian</a></strong>. On an episode of the "Kocktails With Khloé" podcast, she didn't even hesitate to say that she'd swipe right for the actor and she "would bang him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Ice Cube wasn't having it. "She should run full speed from my son," he told <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Corden</a>. "She's a married woman. Be quiet. Khloé, mind your man, girl."</p><h2 id=he-welcomed-a-daughter-in-2017><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Welcomed A Daughter In 2017</span></h2><p>Personally, O'Shea Jackson Jr. can proudly call himself a father now. He welcomed a daughter from his relationship with ex-girlfriend Jackie Garcia in 2017. Even though the two have ended their relationship for good, they will still co-parent their daughter. That also made Ice Cube a grandfather, or in his own words, "Big Daddy Cube."</p><h2 id=now-he-s-gearing-up-for-the-upcoming-obi-wan-kenobi-series-on-disney><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Now, He's Gearing Up For The Upcoming 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' Series On Disney +</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for now, the rising star has been keeping himself busy for the upcoming Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi. He will join the likes of Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan), Hayden Christensen (Darth Vader), Joel Edgerton (Owen Lars), and Bonnie Piesse (Beru Lars).
