Cosgrove then made her film debut with the 2003 film <i>School of Rock</i>. In the movie, she played Summer Hathaway, a young girl with great ambition and discipline who finds herself adjusting to the free-spirited nature of the new <a href=#>Teacher</a> by becoming band manager of the classroom's rock band. <i>School of Rock</i> was both a box office hit, grossing over $131,282,949 worldwide, and critical success, receiving a 91 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes. Cosgrove's acting on the film was praised, with David Ansen of <i>Newsweek</i> describing it as "spot on". She said of the experience of working with Jack Black: "The first week it was like, 'Oh, my God, that's Jack Black,' but two weeks later it was fine. He's really funny. Sometimes the <a href=#>Director</a> would say, 'Jack, you can't make them laugh so much.'" She cited the scene of trying to sing badly as very difficult. Cosgrove stated that "I got a 45-minute lesson from Jim O'Rourke of Sonic Youth on how to sing badly. I've been taking singing lessons for about five years, so getting to sing badly was new. The <a href=#>Director</a> kept saying, 'Try to sing even worse, <a href=#>Miranda</a>,' so it was weird."</p><span>2004</span><p>In 2004 Cosgrove soon landed her first major role in a television series when she was awarded a main role in the Nickelodeon series <i>Drake & Josh</i>, alongside Drake Bell and Josh Peck. In the series, she portrayed Megan Parker, the mischievous younger sister of the title characters.
