I know she would’ve done the same for me, so I wasn’t going to give up until I saw her face again!” Thomar wrote.</p><p>He added further, “I was straight tunnel vision, even when I would get on social media on my downtime & see some of the false allegations & assumptions about me having something to do with her abduction would have me discouraged at times, but I didn’t give up & kept my faith!”</p><p>In a lengthy post, Thomar posted online he started by thanking “my lord & savior Jesus Christ for saving my girlfriend’s life!” He also thanked whoever came out to Hoover Met to join the search party.</p><p>Thomar concluded the post with, “Once again I can’t thank you guys enough for helping us bring Carlee home!
