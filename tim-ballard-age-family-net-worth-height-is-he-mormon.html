Tim founded the organization in 2013 after having served 12 years as a U.S. Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security. He actually quit his job as a special agent to be on a mission to rescue children from cartels and human traffickers in Latin America. And indeed his deeds have paid off in ways he cannot imagine. Just recently, for instance, they released a feature film based on his life and operations. Let us tell you more about it and more about him in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Who Plays Tim Ballard In The Movie Song of Freedom?</strong></h3><p>So, the movie&nbsp;Song of Freedom Tim Ballard is based on Tim Ballard’s true story of devoting himself to fighting child sex trafficking.</p><p>The film is sold as a conservative thriller and it stars Jim Caviezel as Tim Ballard in the lead role. Sporting a trim dark beard and coppery blond hair, the actor portrays Tim.</p><p>Jim, they say, has been a go-to actor for the kind of faith-based projects for the past 19 years since him playing&nbsp;the title role in Mel Gibsons’s The Passion of the Christ.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Tim Ballard’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Tim Ballard reportedly enjoyed an estimated $2 million and plus net worth as of July 2023.</p><p>In addition to shining a light worldwide on the global epidemic of child sex trafficking, Tim has also been the CEO of The Nazarene Fund since November 2017. This one claims to save oppressed religious minorities in the Middle East.</p><p>Tim also is the author of the best-selling Lincoln Hypothesis and Washington Hypothesis (June 2016), and the best-selling book The Covenant and American Covenant series (Digital Legend).</p><p>Tim studied B.A. in Spanish and Political Science at Brigham Young University in the Class of 1999. Then, between 2000 and 2001, he went to the Middlebury Institute of International Studies for a Master of International Politics, Terrorism, and International Crime.</p><h3><strong>Tim Ballard Age</strong></h3><p>Tim Ballard was reportedly born in 1976. So, should this be true, he should have reached the age of 47 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Tim Ballard Family</strong></h3><p>Tim Ballard is very much fond of his parents. He often shows them to his people on social media.</p><p>On days like Mother’s Day, he usually wishes his mother and his wife at the same time citing “Happy Mother’s Day to the wonderful women and girls in my life ❤️”.</p><p>Tim’s mother is Melanie A Ballard, a Donald Trump supporter and a La Canada Flintridge, California dweller. She reached the age of 71 in July 2023. And back in the day, she went to Crescenta Valley Senior High and Brigham Young University.</p><p>As for Tim’s father, Dennis-Ballard, he turned 76 in September 2022. He and Melanie have continued to be married as of 2023. They celebrated their 40th anniversary very long ago, on 29 January 2012.</p><p>Tim’s dad per his LinkedIn, has been the founder of CONCIERGE PARTNERS&nbsp;since 2017.</p><p>Also, so you know, Tim is one of six kids born to his parents.</p><h3><strong>Is Tim Ballard Mormon?</strong></h3><p>Indeed. Tim Ballard is a Mormon and so are his parents. He has also authored many books about Mormonism. And most importantly, he is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Often, in different news articles, Tim has been dubbed as “a product of Mormon psychology”.</p><h3><strong>Is Tim Ballard Still Married?</strong></h3><p>Tim Ballard and his “sweet” wife <a href=#>Katherine Ballard</a> were overcome with gratitude to hear their name announced as the winner of the 2017 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Utah Region Award, back in the day. So, how have they been in recent times? Still, married or not? Here’s what we know.</p><p>Tim and his wife have been actually inseparable since meeting for the first time in 1999 at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Just on 25 April 2023, they celebrated their 23rd anniversary.</p><p>What’s more, the couple also is proud parents of nine amazing kids. Two of them (son Colin and daughter Coline) have been adopted. They were apparently rescued by Tim from traffickers while he was on a sting operation in Haiti.</p><p>The couple’s nine children ranged from ages 23 to 6 as of June 2023.</p><p>Their son Blain Ballard is a volunteer at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Previously, he went to Westlake High School in Utah. Back in May 2019, his parents were super proud that he was called to serve a 2-year church mission in Quito, Ecuador. “It’s a blessing to be his father!!!”, Tim told back then.</p><p>The other son is much younger Daniel. He is the one born during the time Tim and his wife were fighting to get their Haitian kids home. The adoption process took over three years.</p><p>The remaining kids that we know of are daughters Anne and Della.</p><h3><strong>Tim Ballard Height</strong></h3><p>Tim Ballard stands above 5’10” in height.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Tim Ballard’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of now, it was not understood when Tim Ballard’s birthday is.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Tim Ballard Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Until July 2023, Tim Ballard and his family were living somewhere in California.
