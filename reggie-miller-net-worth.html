So now, let’s talk about his earning sources.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_As_A_Player></span>Earnings As A Player<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Not many know, but Reggie Miller comes from an athletic family.

Since then, he played with the Pacers until May 2005. In 18 years of his playing career, he earned $105 million in salary alone. The table below shows the breakdown of Miller’s salary while playing with the Pacers, as per HoopsHype.</p><table id=detail_table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Salary (*Amount after inflation)</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>1990/91</td><td>$654,000 ($1,297,915*)</td></tr><tr><td>1991/92</td><td>$3,211,000 ($6,086,662*)</td></tr><tr><td>1996/97</td><td>$11,250,000 ($18,508,080*)</td></tr><tr><td>2000/01</td><td>$10,670,000 ($15,955,301*)</td></tr><tr><td>2001/02</td><td>$12,045,075 ($17,444,855*)</td></tr><tr><td>2003/04</td><td>$5,000,000 ($7,016,793*)</td></tr><tr><td>2005/06</td><td>$6,000,000 ($7,952,606*)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1996, he had signed four years contract with the Pacers which was worth $9,000,000.

Reggie Miller is also the third-highest 3-point shooter in the NBA</p><p>Miller will always be regarded as one of the greatest players of all time who played for the Pacers. Even after retiring, the successful player continued to be involved in basketball sports.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Salary_As_An_NBA_Commentator></span>Salary As An NBA Commentator<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After retiring, in August 2005, Reggie expressed about joining TNT as an NBA analyst.

He must have signed sponsorship and endorsement deals with several brands.</p><p>Besides being a successful and talented basketball player, he is also a cyclist. In 2001, during the NBA off-season, he got his first taste of mountain biking.&nbsp;Since 2010, Reggie began participating in different MTB races and has entered many XC/Endurance races every year. In December 2020, he was appointed to USA Cycling’s Board of Directors along with <strong>Brendan Quirk, Lucia Deng,</strong> and <strong>Ed Ewing</strong>.</p><p>Reggie participates in different races and collaborates with different brands for cycling gear and equipment. For example, he and Team Boombaby has teamed with Castelli Cycling to release several jerseys and kits.

He must have raised quite a good sum of money that he has donated to several organizations and causes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lifestyle_And_Assets></span>Lifestyle And Assets<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Reggie Miller’s net worth is estimated to be $90 million. And with such a multi-million dollars worth of fortune that he has amassed to his name, there’s no doubt that he lives a comfortable lifestyle. Well, yes, he lives a luxurious life with his partner <strong>Laura Laskowski</strong> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>three kids</a>; among them, two are <strong>Lennox Miller</strong> and <strong>Ryker Miller</strong>. Moreover, he must be paying taxes regularly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Reggie-Miller-with-his-partner-and-kids.jpg><p>In 1995, Reggie purchased a home in Los Angeles for $1.1 million with his ex-wife, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Marita Stavrou</strong></a>. The house with 7,000 square feet of living space was built in Mediterranean style and is located on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood Hills. Moreover, he also owns another home in Fishers, Indiana. He had once listed the house for sale for $7.5 million. However, he did not find any buyer, so he took it off the market.</p><p>Similarly, in 2001, Reggie<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> bought a</a> home for $5.3 million in Malibu, California. In addition, he had a house on Geist Reservoir near the Hamilton County community of Fishers. The house that was located just northeast of Indianapolis had a worth of $1 million. Sadly, the property went up in flames in May 1997. Several valuable items were ruined, and some of them were missing, which indicated the sign of burglary. The fire’s price tag was estimated to be $2 million, which also included possessions.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The Richest, the house’s value at the time of sale in 2014 was $4,500,000. Therefore, he must have made a significant profit from the house sales. In addition, he must have a great car collection and have made a good insurance policy for his cars.</p><p>As Reggie is still very active in his job, there’s no doubt that he will be earning more in the future. Thus, there will likely be an increment in Reggie Miller’s net worth in the future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia_And_Fun_Facts></span>Trivia And Fun Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>He had two brothers, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Saul Miller Jr.</strong></a>, Darrell Miller, and two sisters Cheryl Miller, and Tammy Miller.</li><li>Reggie’s nickname is <strong>Knick Killer</strong>.</li></ul><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p><strong>For More Updates On&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Feuds</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Their Riches</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Siblings</a>, And&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeinrCpsdKtZJydnJqvs7XTopysZ6KatKi1xGakoqScmr9uusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2freggie-miller-net-worth.html&text=Reggie%20Miller%20Net%20Worth%20%20Look%20At%20His%20Salary%20And%20Contracts%20And%20Earning%20Sources&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freggie-miller-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2freggie-miller-net-worth.html&title=Reggie%20Miller%20Net%20Worth%20%20Look%20At%20His%20Salary%20And%20Contracts%20And%20Earning%20Sources" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2freggie-miller-net-worth.html&title=Reggie%20Miller%20Net%20Worth%20%20Look%20At%20His%20Salary%20And%20Contracts%20And%20Earning%20Sources" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2freggie-miller-net-worth.html&title=Reggie%20Miller%20Net%20Worth%20%20Look%20At%20His%20Salary%20And%20Contracts%20And%20Earning%20Sources" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freggie-miller-net-worth.html&description=Reggie%20Miller%20Net%20Worth%20%20Look%20At%20His%20Salary%20And%20Contracts%20And%20Earning%20Sources" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./top-10-best-crystals-for-travel-safety-and-protection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 Best Crystals for Travel Safety and Protection">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./animal-crossing-turnip-lady.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's Everything You Need to Know About &amp;quot;The Stalk Market&amp;quot; in 'Animal Crossing'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
