From his early years, little Jason had always admired filmmakers like Woody Allen who was a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. But having been raised in a neighborhood where people were not as creative as he had wanted, Jason resorted to practicing his acting in front of a mirror.</p><p class=yiv4386951681ydp730201d9msonormal>He was educated in Medfield High School, where he graduated in 1991 after which he enroled into the University of Massachusetts, university time rolled by, he finished and worked as a personal assistant (PA) to a legendary television personality, Norm Macdonald on a popular American late-night television show, <i>Saturday Night Live.</i></p><p class=yiv4386951681ydp730201d9msonormal>To keep his dream of becoming a popular comedian and actor; he got a professional training from Upright Citizens Brigade theatre in Los Angeles to add more knowledge to his expertise as a stand-up comedian.</p><p class=yiv4386951681ydp730201d9msonormal>He joined forces with two other notable comedians to form a sketch comedy troupe, <i>Prince, Nash, and Blieden, </i>the trio formed a formidable comedy force and performed in different comedy festivals and developed notable television shows for TV networks.</p><p class=yiv4386951681ydp730201d9msonormal>In 2001, Jason moved to Hollywood and was cast for a role in <i>Random Play</i>, a comedy series by VH1.
