By the second decade of his career, Jordan's yearly earnings had grown to over $3.8 million, making him the highest paid athlete in the NBA. What might surprise many is that, despite pulling in massive paychecks for most of his career, playing basketball accounts for very little of <a href=#>Jordan’s current massive net worth</a>. Read on to find out exactly how the NBA legend managed to surpass his impressive NBA career in terms of earnings.</p><h2 id=michael-jordan-had-an-impressive-nba-career>Michael Jordan Had An Impressive NBA Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Michael-Jordan-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Known to fans around the world for performing the incredible court stunts that earned him the nickname “Air Jordan,” Michael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time. Bursting into the scene as a center on the legendary Chicago Bulls, Jordan achieved NBA superstar status by the first decade of his career, leading the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and earning countless accolades along the way.</p><p>Jordan’s decades-long career was practically littered with commendable achievements. The now 60-year-old NBA legend boasts of, among other accolades, six NBA Finals MVP awards, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, three NBA steals titles, and two Olympic gold medals.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Juanita Vanoy's Net Worth Skyrocketed Following Her Divorce Settlement From Michael Jordan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the father of five retired from the NBA over two decades ago, his prowess on the court has remained unmatched, as he still holds the NBA records for career scoring average, career playoff scoring average, and career regular season scoring average; an impressive achievement for an athlete whose NBA days have long retreated to the rearview.</p><h2 id=how-much-of-michael-jordan-rsquo-s-wealth-came-from-playing-basketball>How Much Of Michael Jordan’s Wealth Came From Playing Basketball?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Michael-Jordan-2.jpg><p>Michael Jordan’s excellence on the court paid off tremendously. By 1995, Jordan had become the highest paid NBA player of the 1990s. Owing to consistently proving himself indispensable to the Bulls, Jordan became the first ever NBA player to sign a contract worth more than $20 million, signing two one-year contracts worth more than $30 million with the Bulls. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jordan's entire NBA career made him about $93 million; a rare and commendable achievement for the 1990s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan's earnings go up significantly when one considers that his contracts with the Chicago Bulls were not his only moneymaker during his NBA days. During his rookie years, Jordan signed a $2.5 million contract with the footwear mega brand Nike; a move that spawned his revered signature shoe collection, the Air Jordan. With the launch of the Air Jordan 1, Nike brought in a whopping $126 million in sales revenue, despite only anticipating a measly $3 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meet Marcus Jordan: 8 Facts About Michael Jordan's Son</a></span></p><p>That said, Jordan’s earnings from the NBA and celebrity endorsements during this time only account for a small fraction of his net worth. By the time he retired from the NBA in 2003, Jordan’s net worth had only risen to a little under $500 million; a number that pales in comparison to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current $ 2.2 billion net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-michael-jordan-make-his-money>How Does Michael Jordan Make His Money?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MichaelJordan.jpg><p>At $2.2 billion, Michael Jordan is easily the wealthiest athlete on the face of the planet, but just how does he make his money? As it turns out, the NBA superstar’s massive net worth came almost entirely from his brand value.</p><p>Jordan has partnered with multiple brands, including Nike, Coca-Cola, Getorade, Rayovac, Hanes, and Chevrolet; all of which have paid him massive checks for endorsements. According to Celebrity Net Worth, the father of five has made an impressive $1.4 billion from celebrity endorsements alone to-date. Jordan’s annual income has also soared due to endorsement deals, which reportedly earn him a staggering $100 million each year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Michael Jordan’s Model Wife Yvette Prieto Is Worth Millions, But Did She Make Any Of It Herself?</a></span></p><p>Jordan’s business savvy is also a major reason why he’s accumulated such an eye-watering net worth. The father of five has invested in multiple business ventures, including the sports betting company, DraftKings, and the tech startup, Gigster. Jordan has also ventured into filmmaking, accruing an impressive $4 million from his documentary, The Last Dance, all of which he donated to charity.</p><p>Jordan is also a proprietor of several businesses, including multiple restaurants, a Nissan dealership, and a tequila business. However, it’s his majority stake in the NBA Team, the Charlotte Hornets, currently valued at about $1.7 billion, that’s gone a long way in inflating its net worth to its current $2.2 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-michael-jordan-spend-his-money>How Does Michael Jordan Spend His Money?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/michael-jordan-donovan-russel-make-a-wish.jpg><p>With a staggering $2.2 billion net worth, Michael Jordan can spend his money on pretty much anything. The father of five has gone above and beyond in this respect, imbuing his life with as much luxury as possible. Apart from several sprawling mansions, Michael Jordan has also spent his wealth on, among other things, a fleet of top-of-the-line sports cars, a private golf course, his very own private jet, a top-notch security team, and a luxury mega yacht named, Mr. Terrible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordan has also spent a significant chunk of his massive fortune on charitable courses. Most recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the father of five donated a record-breaking $10 million to the Make-A-Wish Foundation</a>; a charity he’s been involved with since his NBA days. Jordan has also devoted his vast resources to championing for social justice, famously pledging to donate a staggering $100 million to organizations fighting for “racial equity, social justice, and greater access to education” back in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecmoqZ2ZnmK7psCMsKarrJhitbDDjKGcZp2Rp7u0ecGio6Whn6PAbrrBmmSpqp%2BivLW1zqeqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-how-he-earns-billions-nba-promotions.html&text=Michael%20Jordan%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%2c%20But%20Very%20Little%20Of%20It%20Came%20From%20His%20NBA%20Days&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-how-he-earns-billions-nba-promotions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-how-he-earns-billions-nba-promotions.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%2c%20But%20Very%20Little%20Of%20It%20Came%20From%20His%20NBA%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-how-he-earns-billions-nba-promotions.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%2c%20But%20Very%20Little%20Of%20It%20Came%20From%20His%20NBA%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-how-he-earns-billions-nba-promotions.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%2c%20But%20Very%20Little%20Of%20It%20Came%20From%20His%20NBA%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-jordan-net-worth-how-he-earns-billions-nba-promotions.html&description=Michael%20Jordan%20Is%20Worth%20Billions%2c%20But%20Very%20Little%20Of%20It%20Came%20From%20His%20NBA%20Days" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rightor-doyle-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-617013-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rightor Doyle Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./benji-krol-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet His Brothers Thomas, Rowyn, and Sister?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
