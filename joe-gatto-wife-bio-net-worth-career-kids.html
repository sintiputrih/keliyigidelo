As we all know, making someone laugh is the hardest skill to have, but surely, this individual is doing great work. <b>Joseph Gatto,</b> AKA <strong>Joe Gatto,</strong> is one of the show’s Tenderloins troupe, ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Impractical Jokers</a>.’ This show has made lots of fans worldwide, and there is more to him and the show.</p><p>Joe is an American improvisational comedian who, after casting in Impractical Jokers, came into the limelight. He is also one of the founders of an American troupe called ‘The Tenderloins.’ The jovial character has a lot to share in his personal and professional life. Here we will let readers know in detail about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Joe-Gatto.jpg><p>Let’s see Joe’s story, bio, career, rise to the limelight.</p><h2>Joseph Gatto: Quick Facts</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Joseph Gatto</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>44 years old</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Date:</th><td>June 05,&nbsp;1976</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Gemini</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place:</th><td>Staten Island, NY, USA</td></tr><tr><th>Father’s Name:</th><td>Joseph Sr.</td></tr><tr><th>Mother’s Name:</th><td>Gerri Gatto</td></tr><tr><th>Education:</th><td>Degree in Accounting</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Comedian, Actor & Producer</td></tr><tr><th>Height:</th><td>5 feet 10 inches (1.78m)</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>$ 500,000</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity:</th><td>Italian-American</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color:</th><td>White/Black</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color:</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Joe Gatto Wife and Kids</strong></h2><p>Joe Gatto is a proud father and a loving husband who is very happy with his family and on social media would always share their posts. There is no information about how they met, but one thing is sure they are made for an extended period.</p><p>On 2 September 2013, Joe married his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Bessy Gatto</strong></a>. Bessy supports her husband very much and is more like his social media manager. It was a pretty close event with the family and friends attending it.</p><p>To support her husband, Joe Gatto’s wife uses all of her social media networks. She has more than <strong>50,000</strong> followers on Instagram. Bessy is 35 years old; she was born on April 11, 1982. Interestingly the wife is a vegetarian who loves to talk about animal rights protection along the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bessy-Gatto-And-Joe-Gatto.jpg><p>Everything was going pretty decent when the couple was blessed with children to strengthen their relationship. <strong>Milana Francine Gatto</strong> was born in 2015 on May 7, two years after the duo got married, their first child. Joe Gatto seems to share a special bond with his daughter, who Gatto calls ‘papa’s girl‘ and shares their pictures on his social media pages.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ysabel Jordan Meaning, Bio, Siblings, Parents, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Joe took to Instagram on February 9, 2017, to announce their son’s arrival. He wrote,</p><h3 style=text-align:center>“Make room girls! Baby brother Gatto will be crashing our tea party this summer #ahumannotapuppy #babynumber2.”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/joe-gatto-kids-5.jpg><p>His son <strong>Remington Joseph Gatto</strong> was born on July 31, 2017. Joe announced the news to his fans via Instagram,</p><h3 style=text-align:center>“I’m excited he’s finally here. [My daughter] Milana made me love being a dad so imagine it’ll now be twice as fun.”</h3><p>Till this point in time, Joe is going pretty well in his career. The love relationship of this man is also outstanding. Due to the lack of no rift, we feel this will go for an extended period.</p><h2><strong>Joe Gatto Wiki-Bio</strong></h2><p>Joe Gatto was born in Staten Island, New York City, USA, as Joseph Anthony Gatto Jr. on June 5, 1976. Gatto attended ‘Monsignor Farrell High School’ and graduated from LIU (Long Island University) with a degree in Accounting.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Impractical Jokers: Know The Net Worth of The Four Jokers >></a></h4><p>It’s somewhat disconcerting for someone who studied accounting to become a comedian, but Joe gave an insight into it and confessed,</p><h3 style=text-align:center>“To be honest, the only reason why I even got an accounting degree is that my father said every company needs an accountant and you can work anywhere and I was also really good at math.”</h3><p>In addition to his comedic career, Gatto worked in a baby retail store until January 2011.</p><h2>Career Of Joe Gatto</h2><p>Can the readers imagine taking up the study material so that you can get the job? Well, Gatto took up accounting as his father suggests an accountant is the need of the time. But life had other plans for the man. In 1999, Joseph founded The Tenderloins comedy troupe with his friends at high school,<strong> Mike Boccio</strong>, <strong>James Murray</strong>, and <strong>Sal Vulcano</strong>.</p><p>However, Brian Quinn later replaced <strong>Mike Boccio</strong>. The troupe is best known for its TV series, Impractical Jokers on TruTv, which won the <strong>$ 100,000</strong> grand prize in NBC’s competition for your show.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MadeinTyo Bio, Age, Height, Career, Relationship >></a></h4><p>In six-show seasons, he has started and is set for the seventh season. Joe also wrote and starred in The Tenderloins 2009 TV movie and appeared in 2014 on the Jokers Wild TV series as well.</p><p>Joe is associated with many charities and causes and often conducts fundraisers for an organization called the Daniel Music Foundation, which mentally and physically challenges members with a comfortable social and economic platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sal-694.jpg><p>Also, Joe supports groups of animals and likes to rescue dogs. He is significant in supporting anti-bullying organizations and is known to work with the RoundTable Hero.</p><p>Together with <strong>Mike Pullano</strong> and <strong>Derek DeAngelis</strong>, he co-hosts a podcast called PBR, an acronym for Pizza Beer Revolution.</p><h2><strong>Family Of Joe Gatto</strong></h2><p>Joseph Gatto is of mixed ethnicity as his family is of Italian ancestry, and Joe often prides himself on his big Italian family.</p><p>He is the youngest of three kids; he has two elder sisters, <strong>Gina</strong>, and <strong>Carla</strong>, with whom he has relationships with ‘best friend.’ Gatto said that,</p><h3 style=text-align:center>“I’m also the youngest of 15 cousins in my generation.”</h3><p>His father’s name is <strong>Joseph Gatto Sr</strong>., and he died of pancreatic cancer in 1995 as a result of excessive alcoholic poisoning, so Joe never touched alcohol all his life. But one thing is sure he is pretty close to all of his family members.</p><p>His mother was also dead. He once worked in the baby retail store in Giggle to support his family until January 2011. So the early time of his life was not pretty decent to share with the readers.</p><h2>Body Measurement Of Joe Gatto</h2><p>He stands at the height of 5 Feet 10 Inches tall.&nbsp; Joe stands at a tall height, and his slim body is the result of the regular workout. His hair color is white and black, and his eye color is dark brown.</p><h2>Joe Gatto Net Worth</h2><p>Comedy is a difficult genre, and the least amount of people are able to master it with ease. Joe has done his bit and also did good on the net worth count. As of now, his net worth stands at <strong>$500,000</strong>.</p><p>Joe’s net worth is known to the general media but what is surprising is the fact that there is hardly anything available about the annual income and assets owned.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>: </strong>1.07 Million followers</li><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>:</strong> 1.4 Million followers</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yaicZp%2BRqcGwedainZ5lkp68brrErWSwp6KptW6vwKucnqpdoLalv44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-gatto-wife-bio-net-worth-career-kids.html&text=Joe%20Gatto%20%3a%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-gatto-wife-bio-net-worth-career-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-gatto-wife-bio-net-worth-career-kids.html&title=Joe%20Gatto%20%3a%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-gatto-wife-bio-net-worth-career-kids.html&title=Joe%20Gatto%20%3a%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-gatto-wife-bio-net-worth-career-kids.html&title=Joe%20Gatto%20%3a%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-gatto-wife-bio-net-worth-career-kids.html&description=Joe%20Gatto%20%3a%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-carpenter-net-worth-14.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Carpenter Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-many-points-is-a-takedown-worth-in-mma.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Many Points is a Takedown Worth in MMA?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
