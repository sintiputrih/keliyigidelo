(<strong>age 31 Years; as of 2021</strong>), in Guadalajara, Mexico. His zodiac sign is Aquarius. His family and friends have given him the nickname Checo. Sergio Perez was born in a family with a racing background. His father, Antonio Pérez Garibay, was a former racing driver who had left racing and switched to the field of managing other racers. Sergio Perez was born before the scheduled delivery because the date was clashing with the 1990s 24 hours after the Daytona race. Antonio convinced the doctors to move up the date of the delivery and Sergio was born through cesarean.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span>Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Height (approx.):&nbsp;</strong>5′ 7″</p><p><strong>Eye Color:&nbsp;</strong>Black</p><p><strong>Hair Color: </strong>Black</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perez-full.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family></span>Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Parents & Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sergio Perez’s father is Antonio Perez Garibay, who was a professional racing driver and now manages other racers as their agent.

He urged both his sons, Antonio and Sergio, to participate in go-karting from an early age. Sergio made his debut in go-karting at the age of six. Tono believed that Sergio was a natural racer and he would tell everyone that Sergio was the best rookie go-kart racer and one day he would make it to the F1 racing. In 1997, Sergio Perez participated in the Youth Class event for go-karting, where he was the youngest among the other drivers. He managed to finish the championship in fourth place with a win and five podium finishes.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perez-left-with-his-brother-Antonio-Perez.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78952 class=wp-caption-text>Sergio Perez (left) with his brother Antonio Perez</p><p>Slowly, Perez shifted from go-karting to bigger engine classes as he attended the National Shifter 125 cc class racing and finished as a runner-up. He grabbed the eleventh position in the Global Shifter 80 cc class. Sergio faced problems at the age of fourteen when he was not allowed to participate in the Cart Grand Prix race at Hermanos Rodriguez racetrack, Mexico. He then met his father’s friend and Mexican billionaire businessman, Carlos Slim Domit, who came forward to help Sergio overcome this problem. Slim offered Sergio his financial support and sponsorship from the Mexican telecommunications company, Telmex. The catch of the deal was that Perez would not be allowed to race in Mexico ever again; initially, he was hesitating, but then he accepted the offer.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Entry_to_Formula_Racing></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Entry_to_Formula_Racing></span><strong>Entry to Formula Racing</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After gaining the sponsorship, Perez moved to the United States to participate in the Skip Barber Championship in 2004. He finished eleventh in the championship, and his remarkable run at the event helped him earn a spot in Germany’s Formula BMW ADAC series. Sergio was fifteen when he left for Germany without a return ticket or any other preparations for his stay. During his time in Germany, he stayed at the restaurant that was owned by his team manager for four months. He was racing for 4speed Media, and in a year, he went from fourteenth place to sixth place. In 2006, Perez participated in the 2006-07 A1 Grand Prix season and he was representing the A1 Team Mexico. In an interview with a sports news channel, Slim talked about Sergio’s sacrifices and hard work and said-</p><p>If anything has set Checo apart from other drivers who have tried to make it to F1, it’s his attitude. Not just his talent. That attitude that he himself has adopted is real, ‘Never Give Up.’ He has never given up and has always performed well. Always. Nobody has given him anything.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perez-at-the-BMW-ADAC-Series-in-Germany.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78953 class=wp-caption-text>Sergio Perez at the BMW ADAC Series in Germany</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Formula_3_to_GP2_Series></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Formula_3_to_GP2_Series></span><strong>Formula 3 to GP2 Series</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2007, Sergio relocated to Oxford, England, and switched to Formula 3 racing to be a part of the two-year campaign in British Formula 3. In those two years, Sergio bagged the National Class racing for older chassis and stood fourth in the International Class in 2008. After racing in Formula 3, Perez drove for Campos Grand Prix at the 2008-09 GP2 Asia Series. Perez registered his first GP2 win at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, and his second win was at Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Later, he went for the Formula 1 feeder championship i.e. 2009 GP2 Series, and finished the series at the twelfth position.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perez-at-the-British-Formula-3-campaign.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78954 class=wp-caption-text>Sergio Perez at the British Formula 3 campaign</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sergio_in_Sauber_2011-2012></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sergio_in_Sauber_2011-2012></span><strong>Sergio in Sauber (2011-2012)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In October 2010, Sauber, a Swiss motorsport engineering company announced that they had signed Sergio for the 2011 season. Furthermore, they also took Telmex on board as they were Sergio’s sponsors. Sergio also joined the Ferrari Driver Academy scheme in the same year. In his first race at the Australian Grand Prix, Perez took a bold step of stopping only once for the pitstop which surprisingly, impressed the viewers, and he managed to finish seventh in the race. Unfortunately, both the team cars were disqualified after the race for violating certain technical regulations. During the Monaco Grand Prix in 2011, Sergio Perez was involved in a crash when he lost control of his car while coming out of the tunnel, and he crashed his car into an impact-absorbing tech pro barrier. Sergio suffered a concussion and a sprained thigh. In an interview, Sergio talked about the accident and said-</p><p>Of course I think back to the accident I had in Q3 last year. To me it is like a watershed event in my career. There is a time before and a time after the accident. I learnt a lot from what I had to go through and I think it made me stronger. I really want to show what I can do in Monte Carlo.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perezs-car-after-the-crash-at-Monaco-Grand-Prix.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78955 class=wp-caption-text>Sergio Perez’s car after the crash at Monaco Grand Prix</p><p>In 2012, the beginning of the year was slow as Perez didn’t have much success in the first few races. At the Malaysian Grand Prix, Sergio competed with Fernando Alonso for the first position, but he went wide on one of the turns and had to settle for second place. He earned the second podium finish of his career at the Canadian Grand Prix where he stood third in the race. At the British Grand Prix, Pastor Maldonado’s aggressive driving style caused a collision between him and Sergio for which Pastor was fined a double penalty and €10,000. Sergio had to retire because of a broken suspension. He later criticized Pastor and said-</p><p>Everybody has concerns about him. He is a driver who doesn’t know that we are risking our lives and has no respect at all. Just look at the last races. He ruined Hamilton’s race (in Valencia), he ruined my race in Monaco by doing stupid things. I don’t understand why the stewards don’t take a serious decision with him. With Pastor they’re not doing anything that will teach him a lesson.”</p><p>Sergio Perez had his third podium finish of the year 2012 at the Italian Grand Prix. He started the race with hard tires and after completing 29 laps, he took a pitstop and switched to medium tires for the rest of the race. This technique helped him earn a podium finish.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perez-celebrating-his-podium-finish-with-Lewis-Hamilton-left-at-the-2012-Italian-GP.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78956 class=wp-caption-text>Sergio Perez celebrating his podium finish with Lewis Hamilton (left) at the 2012 Italian GP</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Moving_to_McLaren_for_Mercedes_2013></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Moving_to_McLaren_for_Mercedes_2013></span><strong>Moving to McLaren for Mercedes (2013)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2013, Lewis Hamilton decided to leave McLaren for Mercedes, and as his replacement, Sergio Perez was hired by the team. In the first few GPs, Perez faced some troubles in getting familiar with the car; however, at the Bahrain GP, Sergio started in the twelfth position and finished the race in sixth place. He drove slightly aggressively to mark his win, and this was not appreciated by Jenson Button. In the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix, Sergio got into an accident after he collided with Kimi Räikkönen while overtaking him during the race. Later, Räikkönen criticized Perez and said that he should be punched in the face.

Sergio Perez was struck with bad luck when his car faced braking issues while he was competing for another podium finish. In the last lap of the race, his car collided with the car of Felipe Massa, who rear-ended Perez’s car, sending both the cars into the barriers. Later, he was given a five-place penalty for the next race as the officials decided that Perez changed his racing line suddenly and caused a crash.

The best race of the season was when Sergio scored the podium in Russia. By the end of the championship, Sergio was in the ninth position, which was his highest championship position till 2015.</p><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=2016_Formula_World_Championship></span>2016 Formula World Championship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>The beginning of 2016 was slightly rough for Sergio as his VJM09 vehicle was not upgraded as compared to the other cars. The upgraded version of the car was introduced in Barcelona GP where he managed to finish in seventh place. Perez outdid himself when he won a podium finish at the Monaco Grand Prix in wet and changing conditions.&nbsp; During the race, he pitted as much as the Ferrari and Red Bull drivers, but tire management played a major role in the race. Another podium finish came for him at the European Grand Prix in Baku, Azerbaijan.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sergio-Perez-after-his-podium-finish-at-the-2016-Azerbaijan-Grand-Prix.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-78960 class=wp-caption-text>Sergio Perez after his podium finish at the 2016 Azerbaijan Grand Prix</p><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=2017_Formula_World_Championship></span>2017 Formula World Championship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>It was rumored that for the 2017 season, Perez might move to Williams Racings, Renault, or Haas F1 Team, but at the Malaysian Grand Prix, he proved his commitment towards the team, working along with a new teammate Esteban Ocon. The highest finish he had for 2017 was when he ended up in fourth place at the Spanish Grand Prix. In the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Sergio was aiming for the win when and competing hard, but he ended up colliding with his teammate Ocon. He was in the seventh position for the rest of the championship.</p><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=2018_Formula_World_Championship></span>2018 Formula World Championship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>At the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Sergio finished in third place making it the eighth podium finish of his career. With this, he became the first driver to finish twice on the podium at the Baku City Circuit. Unfortunate events took place when Force India was put under administration because of some creditors’ complaints. These creditors took legal action against the team; Perez explained that the action was taken to save the whole team from shutting down. Before the Belgian Grand Prix, a group of investors led by Lawrence Stroll, father of Williams Racing driver Lance Stroll, purchased the assets of Force India’s team to keep the team. The name of the team was rebadged to Racing Point Force India.</p><p>The team made a smashing comeback at the Belgian Grand Prix, as both, Perez and Ocon, finished fifth and sixth respectively. Perez performed poorly at the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix as he collided with his teammate in the opening lap causing Ocon to retire from the race. He was given a drive-thru penalty for his irresponsible driving. In October 2018, his car suffered a brake failure, and had to retire from the race.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Racing_Point_2019-2020></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Racing_Point_2019-2020></span><strong>Racing Point (2019-2020)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=2019_Formula_One_World_Championship></span>2019 Formula One World Championship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>In 2019, Racing Point Force India transformed into Racing Point and they kept Sergio Perez as their driver.
