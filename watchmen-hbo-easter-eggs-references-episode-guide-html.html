Who? Who?<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3092udg007eyey6b6pjvwn6@published data-word-count=96>HBO’s <a href=#>Watchmen</a> doesn’t just adapt Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’s wildly influential DC comic — it tells a whole new story set in its rich universe, 34 years after the action of the source material. As such, it includes dozens of nods to the characters and action of the book, some embedded right in its plot but many in background details or throwaway references. With so much story to keep track of every week, it can be hard to catch everything that <a href=#>Damon Lindelof</a> & Co. are throwing at you, so let us guide the way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30c7guu00243g68shsnkwrl@published data-word-count=147>First, a clarification: We’re in this only for the deep cuts that go straight back to the source. The line between Easter egg and plot point has become blurry in some quarters over the past few years. That the Seventh Kalvary wears Rorschach masks is plot. That the egg yolk Angela drops in a bowl visually recalls the cover of the first issue and the death of the Comedian is an Easter egg (in a very literal way). So we’re here for the references and callbacks to Watchmen, not the story, which often ties in to the source material in very direct ways. So don’t comment that Jeremy Irons playing Adrian Veidt is an Easter egg — that’s just casting. And we’re not here for the fact that the Clarks from the episode-four prologue are likely a reference to Clark Kent, either. Just Watchmen-brand eggs sold here.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30c7gwm00273g68zf2hawig@published data-word-count=89>And before we get too deep, let us advise you to check out a cool bit of marketing from HBO itself, a series of files created by the fictional character of Dale Petey, Laurie Blake’s partner on the show. It’s called <a href=#>Peteypedia</a>, and offers some hints as to where the show is going and how some of these references play a role. Finally, props to Syfy, Thrillist, ScreenRant, Den of Geek, and Insider for assistance in catching some of these. Who watches the people who watch Watchmen?

Sheriff Crawford plays a video from the cop-killing group in the premiere, and we hear someone say, “Soon, all the whores and race traitors will shout ‘Save us!’ And we will whisper, ‘No.’” It’s a quote from the journal/source: “The accumulated filth and all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout ‘Save us!’ … and I’ll look down and whisper ‘No.’” It’s also likely not coincidental that the quote appears in the first issue of the comic book and the first episode of the series.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck30cem9y005o3g68cbuo2t85@published>Under the Hood&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6bb/023/7716b7557f73af07b0aa2709cd7dc41b64-watchmen-episode-1-06-2.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30c7hcz002f3g68z1a1l08x@published data-word-count=91>Eagle-eyed (or should that be owl-eyed?) fans noticed that a copy of a book called Under the Hood is sitting on the desk in the sheriff’s office. This is a major callback to the source material. In the comic book, Under the Hood was the name of the autobiography of Hollis T. Mason, a.k.a. Nite Owl. Chapters of Watchmen ended with excerpts from Under the Hood, which the good sheriff is reading casually. There are a lot of connections between the Sheriff and Nite Owl, but those are for another piece.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck30cntyo00613g683zic8mlg@published>Owl Mug</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/daf/e24/9b321e8b0bd7f071fe4f6e224be869db78-watchmen-episode-1-06.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck30c7hfr002g3g68j9xgaa51@published data-word-count=56>While we’re on the subject, Angela sits in Judd’s office and sips from a mug that looks a lot like Nite Owl himself.

First, the command to unlock the computer is “UNTIE KNOT,” a reference to the Gordian Knot, an infamous knot with which Veidt was obsessed in the comic. The story goes that the man who could untie it would be king of Asia, but Alexander the Great chose the shortcut of cutting it instead. It is also the name of a lock company in the source. You’ll also notice that Veidt’s password is “RAMESES II.” The Egyptian Pharaoh was also known as Ozymandias.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck48v0zcu00183g67e43lgrto@published>Rameses II</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck48v978i001c3g67tlp1avqg@published data-word-count=65>The references to the other Ozymandias aren’t done. In the book, Veidt claims to be quoting Rameses, and those lines are repeated directly in the finale when Veidt realizes the scope of Lady Trieu’s plan: “Canaan is devastated, Ashkelon is fallen, Gezzer is ruined, Venoam is reduced to nothing, Israel is desolate her seed is no moe, and Palestine has become a widow for Egypt.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck48vchr9001g3g678ghr2wm0@published>“The end is nigh”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck48vcwtc001k3g67o40mfrsq@published data-word-count=44>Veidt delivers a phrase that even the most casual Watchmen fan would associate with the source material.
