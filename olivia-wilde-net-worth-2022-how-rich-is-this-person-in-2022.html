I think people see pregnancy as something to get over with, but every stage of becoming a mother is really special.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The difference between romantic love and friendship love is that romantic love involves a lot of compromises. It is a very giving type of love. With friendship, you can be a little bit more autonomous. You are not expected to compromise, in the same way. Maybe that’s why friendships tend to last longer.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The mark of a good marriage is the partnership and continuing to feel inspired by your spouse. I had that with Tao. But the end is not necessarily the tragedy. Staying in a relationship that is no longer working is a tragedy. Living unhappily – that’s the tragedy.”</p><p>“I have a lot of friends who I really feel like I can kick back with and let all pretense go and be very comfortable with.”&nbsp;</p><p>“As a woman who works in a male-dominated business – Hollywood, definitely, is one of them – I instinctually knew what that is like. You have to be strong and take care of yourself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6S5qsLImmSwoZyZsm66xK1ksKeiqbVufo9raWagn6x6s7XCoWSiq12ptaq%2FjKmcq6ufo3qquoxrZ2tqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html&text=Olivia%20Wilde%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20How%20Rich%20Is%20This%20Person%20In%202022%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html&title=Olivia%20Wilde%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20How%20Rich%20Is%20This%20Person%20In%202022%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html&title=Olivia%20Wilde%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20How%20Rich%20Is%20This%20Person%20In%202022%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html&title=Olivia%20Wilde%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20How%20Rich%20Is%20This%20Person%20In%202022%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-wilde-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-this-person-in-2022.html&description=Olivia%20Wilde%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20How%20Rich%20Is%20This%20Person%20In%202022%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tmobile-announces-amrwb-hd-voice-calls-active-on-its-network.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="T-Mobile Announces AMR-WB (HD Voice) Calls Active on its Network">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nicole-eggert-trades-in-baywatch-suit-for-ice-cream-truck-pictures-2014810.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicole Eggert Trades In Baywatch Suit For Ice Cream Truck: Pictures">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
