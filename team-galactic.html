Cyrus then revealed to Saturn and Mars that he had no intention of bringing them with him to this new world. After Dialga and Palkia were freed, the portal began to close and a desperate Cyrus jumped into the portal and never was seen again. Just in time, Ash, Dawn, and Brock helped the lake guardians to calm the two Legendary dragons and save <a href=# title=Sinnoh>Sinnoh</a>, while Mars and Saturn were arrested by Looker and Charon nowhere to be found. With the Adamant and Lustrous Orbs recovered, three of the Commanders arrested, Charon gone, and Cyrus missing, Team Galactic was finished and their plans to destroy Sinnoh were finally brought to an end.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h4><p>Sometime after their arrest, the members of Team Galactic escaped custody and resumed their activity at their old headquarters. Now under the leadership of Saturn, Mars and Jupiter, the team pursued the goal of reopening the portal Cyrus disappeared into and retrieving him from it. To this end, they acquired <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Arceus</a>'s <a href=# title="Flame Plate">Flame Plate</a> and developed a beam weapon for use in reopening the portal.

Coronet. This successfully opened the portal, but the energy soon overflowed and caused an explosive backlash. The destruction of the weapon caused the portal to close again, but left a dimensional rift behind. Heatran, meanwhile, was exposed to the energy from the weapon and went berserk, melting its <a href=# title="Dusk Ball">Dusk Ball</a> to escape Saturn's control before consuming the Flame Plate. This caused Heatran to transform into a gigantic, monstrous new form and go on a rampage, destroying the Team Galactic HQ before setting off to reach the rift. Team Galactic gave chase in a helicopter, discovering Ash, Dawn, Brock, and Goh also following Heatran en route. Team Galactic landed and engaged the group in battle to prevent them from stopping Heatran, with Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter sending out Toxicroak, Purugly, and Skuntank respectively. The lake guardians arrived at Arceus's direction to try and calm Heatran, but this failed and Heatran underwent another transformation, becoming a monster made out of magma.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JNS03>The Arceus Chronicles (Part 3)</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=JNS04>The Arceus Chronicles (Part 4)</a></i>, the Commanders made their final stand against Ash, Dawn, Brock and Goh. <a href=# title="Cynthia (anime)">Cynthia</a> arrived to assist in the battle against them, and captured them using her <a href=# title="Roserade (Pokémon)">Roserade</a>'s <a href=# title="Power Whip (move)">Power Whip</a>. During the battle, the space-time portal once again reopened. It was also discovered that Heatran was actually trapped inside of the rampaging magma creature, suffering from the power of the Flame Plate overwhelming its <a href=# title="Flash Fire (Ability)">Flash Fire</a> <a href=# title=Ability>Ability</a>. Arceus joined the Lake Trio to help the heroes stop the creature's rampage, but first, it used its powers to close the portal again, much to the horror of Team Galactic's members. Team Galactic remained bound to a boulder for the duration of the mission to save Heatran. Afterward, as Arceus departed, Saturn called out to it and begged for it to bring Cyrus back, only for it to ignore them and return to <a href=# title=Dimension>its home</a>. Saturn, Mars and Jupiter, faced with the failure of their dream and the reality of returning to custody, resigned themselves in sadness to the fact that they would never be able to save Cyrus.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Generations></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Generations>Pokémon Generations</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b0/Galactic_Grunts_PG.png/375px-Galactic_Grunts_PG.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Team Galactic appeared in <i><a href=# title=PG11>The New World</a></i>.
