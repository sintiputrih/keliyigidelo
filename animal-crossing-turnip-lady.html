The social simulation game <a href=#>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> makes a lot of the mundane and even grueling tasks of life pretty fun and adorable, from arranging furniture to gardening to, yes, trading stocks. Or stalks.</p><p>Instead of selling shares of blue chip companies, the game simulates the New York Stock Exchange with turnips. Yes, turnips. Here's everything you need to know about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turnip lady on Animal Crossing</a> and the risky business of trading "stalk."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When and where to buy turnips in 'Animal Crossing':</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure><p>Every Sunday on Animal Crossing between the hours of 5 a.m. and 12 p.m., you will see a little pig with a runny nose walking around your island selling her wares. If you played earlier versions of the game, this minigame is familiar to you, only you dealt with Daisy's grandmother, Sow Joan of the eponymous Sow Joan's Stalk Market. (We love a good pun.)</p><p>Turnips are sold in groups of 10 and while you can eat them, it's not the best use of your money. Instead, you should hang onto them and check with Timmy and Tommy each day to see what the purchase price for turnips is that day. You have a week — that is until 5 a.m the following Sunday — to sell your stock before it rots, so there's some risk and time constraint involved if you want to turn a profit on your investment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who wants to come sell turnips today?<br>Timmy and Tommy out here being crooks with these turnip prices.<a href=#>#AnimalCrossingNewHorizions</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P5zB7L4iqj</a></p>— misslamabean (@misslamabean) <a href=#>March 30, 2020</a></figure><p>The key to making money on turnips is to buy at a low price and sell at a high price, but if you're new to the trading floor, you might not know what an attractive price on the buying or selling end is. Don't worry, we've got you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the range for turnip prices on 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons'?</h2><p>Just as with stock prices, the going rate for turnips changes every day and can fluctuate throughout the day, so it's a good idea to check the price more than once a day. Typically, the cost per turnip ranges from 80 to 120 bells, but they can be lower than 50 and over 400 on a good day.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, it's safest to buy turnips when the price is under 100. Anything higher and there's a high risk you won't even break even, let alone make money. Most of the time, Tuesday is the best day for selling, but if you purchased a particularly pricey batch, you may want to hold out for a surprise jump in price.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wishing for Timmy and Tommy to raise their turnip prices so I can make a profit from my "Stalk Market" gamble.<a href=#>#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href=#>#ACNH</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7V73UpW3Qc</a></p>— Connor Jackson 🎮 (@TweetsByConnorJ) <a href=#>March 26, 2020</a></figure><p>A word to the wise, though. Many gamers like to "time travel" in Animal Crossing — that is they manually change the date and time settings on their Switch to move forward and backward in time and date — to hack the system. This is beneficial if you've missed a window for an in-game character's visit to your island or to speed up construction. However, time travel will really hurt you when it comes to the "stalk market," because if you jump forward past the next Sunday, your turnips will automatically rot.</p><p>And while you can go forward any time before that Sunday to check stalk prices or do anything else you like, you have to sell your turnips before jumping back to the present. Any move backward in time after a jump forward will cause your turnips to spoil.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to store turnips on 'Animal Crossing':</h2><p>OK, so you've decided to play, but what are you supposed to do now, just carry around those turnips until the stalk price goes up? Well, we have bad news for those who are a little anal about how they arrange their houses on Animal Crossing. Unfortunately, you can't put your turnips in storage, so most traders just leave them in their home to keep their pockets free.</p><p>Another option is to bury them in your yard. They won't grow into plants the same way buried fruit grow into trees, and you can dig them up when you're ready to sell.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I found this idea on where to store turnips, as you can't put them in your house storage and carrying them around is annoying - and it's adorable!!</p><p>Plus visitors can't steal them, cause the fences 😗 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gmR5HcWEIk</a></p>— Ryan in the Horizon ✨ (@CrossingRyan) <a href=#>March 24, 2020</a></figure><p>Burying turnips comes with the risk of plunder if you have visitors to your island, though, so indoors is safest. You can also create a fenced-in "silo" of sorts for your turnip stores if you're concerned about piracy. While you can move the fencing to gain access to your turnips whenever you want, visitors won't be able to get in.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happens if your turnips rot?</h2><p>Well, basically you lose all the money you invested, which is a bummer, but there is an upside to bug collectors. Rotten turnips attract ants and flies, which would otherwise never spawn, so if you're looking to add those specimens to the insect hall of your museum, that's one way to do it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#AnimalCrossing</a> <a href=#>#ACNH</a><br>Got rotten turnips? Place those spoiled boys out<br>and let the ants come for you to catch! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/v7F9RfExWa</a></p>— 🍀 Clover-hime (@LuckyNekoClover) <a href=#>March 29, 2020</a></figure><p>However, it's a small silver lining to taking a loss on your investment. But ask any finance bro on Wall Street and they'll tell you there's no great reward without great risks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruqucClZJyqn6jAqrrGZquuqp6evW64wJ2w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanimal-crossing-turnip-lady.html&text=Here%27s%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%26quot%3bThe%20Stalk%20Market%26quot%3b%20in%20%27Animal%20Crossing%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanimal-crossing-turnip-lady.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanimal-crossing-turnip-lady.html&title=Here%27s%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%26quot%3bThe%20Stalk%20Market%26quot%3b%20in%20%27Animal%20Crossing%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanimal-crossing-turnip-lady.html&title=Here%27s%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%26quot%3bThe%20Stalk%20Market%26quot%3b%20in%20%27Animal%20Crossing%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanimal-crossing-turnip-lady.html&title=Here%27s%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%26quot%3bThe%20Stalk%20Market%26quot%3b%20in%20%27Animal%20Crossing%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanimal-crossing-turnip-lady.html&description=Here%27s%20Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20%26quot%3bThe%20Stalk%20Market%26quot%3b%20in%20%27Animal%20Crossing%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reggie-miller-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reggie Miller Net Worth  Look At His Salary And Contracts And Earning Sources">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./angelina-melnikova.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angelina Melnikova - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
