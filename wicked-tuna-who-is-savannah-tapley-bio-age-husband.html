Tuna fishing expert and New Hampshire native Tyler has been on this show since day one. Albeit in recent times, he has not had fans curious about his finest skills as a fisherman but about his ex-girlfriend Savannah Tapley. Fans since discovering that they are no more together, could not help but wonder what is his ex-lady up to and who she really is other than being known as Tyler‚Äôs ex.</p><h3><strong>Wicked Tuna: Meet Savannah Tapley, Tyler McLaughlin‚Äôs Ex-Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Viewers remember Savannah Tapley from the time when she appeared on the National Geographic Channel show with her then-boyfriend Tyler Mclaughlin. She was seen on two regular episodes of the National Geographic Channel show; in one ‚ÄúBest Of‚Äùinstallment; and one episode of the spinoff Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks. We can still see her join Tyler abroad the Pinwheel as a deckhand in a promo for a 2017 episode of Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my girlfriend on this trip‚Äù, Tyler had then said proudly. In the same trailer, Tyler also had promised Savannah that if they land this time, he is going to call her his ‚Äúlucky banana‚Äù.</p><p>Looking back on Instagram, their relationship seemed to have lit up between 2017 and 2018. Savannah‚Äôs social media still includes all memories of them together from that time. She also showed him love on Twitter. But of course, none of it was meant to last.</p><p>There‚Äôs this speculation that they had been dating since 2015 and were even engaged. But clearly, they were no longer a couple as of 2022.</p><p>It remained unclear as to why they broke up.</p><h3><strong>Savannah Tapley Husband Today</strong></h3><p>As of today (June of 2022) the above-discussed exes had moved on. They both seemed to be in a relationship with other people.</p><p>By 2019, Savannah was posting pictures with her now-husband, Nicolas Harriman. They later got married on 30 April 2021 in a small ceremony at ViewPoint Hotel in York, Maine.</p><p>‚ÄúI got to marry my best friend and soul mate and we couldn‚Äôt be happierü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù, Savannah had taken to write on Facebook the next day. She also thanked her ‚Äúamazing‚Äù mother-in-law for making her wedding dress.</p><p>Moreover, the bride already had a baby bump showing on her wedding day and so she and her husband welcomed their daughter in the summer of that year (17 July 2021). They named her Natalie Jean, aka Nattyj.</p><p>Also, before tying the knots, Nicholas had planned a surprise proposal, gone down one knee and with a beautiful ring had asked Savannah to marry him. This happened a month before their swapped their vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/wicked-tuna-who-is-savannah-tapley-bio-age-husband-2022-1-300x300.jpg><p>Nicholas, as per his LinkedIn, has been an insurance agent at&nbsp;State Farm&nbsp;for the past 3-and-a-half-year.
