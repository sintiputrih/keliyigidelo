He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 14, 1966. Harry Schneider is his father’s name, and Carol Schneider is his mother’s name. He was raised by his three older sisters. Similarly, he is the Schneiders’ youngest kid. He grew up in a serene and beautiful environment, surrounded by love from his parents and sisters.</p><p>Similarly, he is of American descent, but his ethnicity is uncertain.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Dan Schneider made an appearance at his alma mater, White Station High School, in his hometown. During high school, he was elected Senior Class President. Schneider appears to have a strong academic background. He went to Harvard University after graduating from high school. He dropped out after the first semester at his father’s alma college.</p><p>Later, he returned to Memphis and enrolled at the University of Memphis, now Memphis State University. At the same time, he began conducting computer repair work.</p><h2>Professional Life and career</h2><p>A movie producer noticed him while he was studying and pushed him to audition. He does, however, give the audition and is cast in the part. He afterwards relocated to Los Angeles and began working in the entertainment sector. For his daily expenses, he worked as a pizza delivery boy when he first arrived in Los Angeles.</p><p>Schneider has also been working in the entertainment industry since 1984. In the teen comedy film “Making The Grade,” he had his first acting job. His role was only temporary.</p><p>During the 1980s, Schneider appeared in films such as Better Off Dead, Hot Resort, Happy Together, Listen To Me, The Big Picture, and the TV series Head Of The Class. During those days, he was really busy.</p><p>He was also engaged by Nickelodeon for a new sketch comedy show for kids called All That (1994-2005). He wrote the pilot episode’s script during that year. Throughout the next few seasons, he also served as a producer, executive producer, and writer for the show. He’s also credited as a co-writer on the 1997 film Good Burger.</p><p>Similarly, in 2002, he co-created the WB sitcom “What I like about you” with a former “Friends” producer. With the sitcom Drake & Josh on Nickelodeon in 2004, he made a comeback. He also gave Nickelodeon a slew of new programming, including iCarly, Zoey 101, Victorious, Sam & Cat, and Game Shakers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dan-schneider.jpg><p>On March 26, 2018, Nickelodeon crushed the hearts of a million Schneider fans when they announced that their production deal with him would not be extended.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>Schneider’s first nomination was for All That for Children’s Series-7 and Older for the year 1995, according to his awards and nominations. However, in the year 2000, he won his first award for ‘Best Comedy Film’ for ‘The Amanda Show.’ He had also been nominated for a number of awards since 2005. In 2014, he received the ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’ for the second time at the Kids’ Choice Awards.</p><h2>Relationship status</h2><p>Schneider is, in fact, a married man. In 2002, he married Lisa Lillien, his long-term girlfriend. This couple’s bond has been extremely solid, with no signs of divorce in the near future. They are in a great relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dan-Schneider-1-1.jpg><p>In terms of his previous relationship, Schneider began his career in the entertainment sector at the age of 18 in 1984. Until he met Lisa Lillie, the founder of The Hungry Girl empire, he was solely focused on his business and avoided relationships.</p><h2>Scandals</h2><p>Schneider was sacked from Nickelodeon with a $7 million severance package. Following that, a flurry of rumors centered on his name began to circulate. Since then, the internet has been flooded with many videos, blogs, and articles. His foot fetish has been discussed.</p><h2>Fetish Foot</h2><p>Schneider has been tweeting about toes and feet since 2009, and his tweets have gotten a lot of attention. Based on his social media posts, several sites have concluded that Schneider has a foot fetish. Since early 2009, he has made numerous posts, lighting a fire in the pool of fuel. He also appears to have been publishing photos and a few posts about the feet of some of the cast members from his own program. Some fans appear to have mistook it for a joke and retweeted it, oblivious to his foot fetish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dan-Schneider-1-2.jpg><h2>&nbsp;Advantage of the post</h2><p>Another rumor about him was that he used his position at Nickelodeon to create shows concerning kids’ feet. He was worried about one character’s smooth feet for a whole episode of Victorious. After touching Daniella Monet’s character’s foot, an adult exclaims, “Wow, they’re incredibly soft!” Similarly, his written show’s similar lines have sparked debate.</p><p>Schneider was also chastised for including adult humor in children’s television shows.</p><h2>Social Media and Body Measurements</h2><p>Dan Schneider stands at a fantastic height of 6 feet and weighs roughly 110 kilograms (72 inches). He has, however, been attempting to lose weight for a long time. Similarly, he acquired golden blonde hair and brown eyes as a child.</p><p>Schneider is active on social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. He has a sizable fan base. He also has over 176k Facebook likes, 761k Twitter followers, and 270k Instagram followers.</p><h3 class=normal>More Facts of Dan Schneider</h3><table class="table table-striped facts"><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Dan Schneider</td></tr><tr><th>Born Date:</th><td>14 Jan, 1966</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>56 years</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Number:</th><td>10</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Stone:</th><td>Topaz</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Color:</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Best Match for Marriage:</th><td>Scorpio, Virgo, Taurus</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Producer</td></tr><tr><th>Country:</th><td>USA</td></tr><tr><th>Height:</th><td>6 feet 0 inches (1.83m)</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>married</td></tr><tr><th>Wife</th><td>Lisa Lillien</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$30 million</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Golden blonde</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place</th><td>Memphis, Tennessee</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Education</th><td>University of Memphis,</td></tr><tr><th>Father</th><td>Harry Schneider</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>Carol Schneider</td></tr><tr><th>Siblings</th><td>Three</td></tr><tr><th>Facebook</th><td><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dan Schneider Facebook</a></td></tr><tr><th>Twitter</th><td><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dan Schneider Twitter</a></td></tr><tr><th>Instagram</th><td><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dan Schneider Instagram</a></td></tr><tr><th>Personal Web</th><td><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dan Schneider Personal Web</a></td></tr><tr><th>IMDB</th><td><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dan Schneider IMDB</a></td></tr><tr><th>Wiki</th><td><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dan Schneider Wiki</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJyRo3q0r8ennKKclad8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdan-schneider.html&text=Dan%20Schneider&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdan-schneider.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdan-schneider.html&title=Dan%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdan-schneider.html&title=Dan%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdan-schneider.html&title=Dan%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdan-schneider.html&description=Dan%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erika-de-la-rosa-net-worth-143465.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erika De la Rosa Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./worlds-tallest-couple.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="150 Years Later, This Is Still The World's Tallest Couple">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
