He hailed from Jacksonville, Florida, and his zodiac sign was Gemini. Similarly, late Corbin attended the Duval County Public Schools.</p><p>Talking about his family, his mother is Milissa Morman-Jackson, and his father’s name is James Curtis Johnson, Jr. Various sources also mention Corey Morman as Corbin’s father. Similarly, he had three siblings namely Faith Johnson, Alfred, and Broderick.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-238429 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Corbin-Johnson-in-a-childhood-photo-with-his-father.jpg alt="Corbin Johnson" width=650 height=745 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-238429 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Corbin in a childhood photo with his father. Source: Funerals by T.S. Warden</p><h2><span id=Disappearance>Disappearance</span></h2><p>Corbin Johnson gained fame for being a murder victim at the young age of 18 years old in 2019. Corbin went missing in July 2018.</p><p>A year after his disappearance, a man discovered Corbin’s remains in the woods. In July 2019, a man clearing in the woods found a body’s remains wrapped in a bag. The police took four days to link the remains to Corbin Johnson. Moreover, Corbin’s date of demise is recorded as 15 July 2019, which might be the day his body was discovered.</p><p>Jahreeka Sims and her friend were a few of the last people to see this personality alive. Corbin had told Sims via a FaceTime video call that he was at Amazon for a job interview. This late teenager also told Sims that he was waiting for a ride.</p><p>On the day of his disappearance, his father – Corey Morman – had dropped him off for another interview with UPS at 5 pm. Later, Corey picked him up 45 minutes later. After he left this late personality at his mother’s house at 8 pm, his mother last saw him at half past nine. After a failed combined search effort to locate this late teenager, search efforts went cold quickly.</p><p>Authorities classified this late teenager’s death as a homicide. Likewise, the authorities also called on the community to help solve the murder. As of December 2021, the police are yet to find the person guilty of this young teenager’s murder.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-238424 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Corbin-Johnsons-case-was-being-investigated-as-a-murder-case-in-2019.jpg alt="Corbin Johnson" width=650 height=366 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-238424 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Corbin’s case was being investigated as a murder case in 2019.

As far as we know, this young lad was busy attending interviews to secure a stable job even on the day he went missing in 2018. There we can only assume that this late teenager wasn’t involved in any income-generating activities.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Corbin Johnson was <strong>single</strong> at the time of his demise in 2018/2019. Johnson was more focused on securing a future through a stable job and even had an interview on the day he went missing. Therefore, the young lad might not have had time to be involved in romantic affairs and controversies.</p><h2><span id=Corbin_Johnson_8211_Body_Measurements>Corbin Johnson – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Late Corbin Johnson’s body measurements like his height, weight, chest-waist-hip measures, dress size, etc. are all mysteries. Johnson had curly black hair and eyes of the same color.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Corbin Johnson is not available on any social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Despite not having any profiles, he went viral on TikTok after a song featuring his name went viral on this platform.</p><p>The said viral song was created by rapper Foolio. The listeners had mixed reactions to Foolio’s song about Corbin. While some called it insensitive, others were stunned to see the lyrics of the song in Corbin’s case where the rapper mentioned the late teenager’s kidnapping, missing case, and how his remains were discovered.</p><h2><span id=i><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Corbin-Johnson-in-photographs-with-his-parents.jpg alt="Corbin Johnson" width=650 height=372 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></h2><p>Caption: Corbin in photographs with his parents.
