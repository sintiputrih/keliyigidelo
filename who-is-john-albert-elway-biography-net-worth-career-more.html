He currently serves as the president of football operations for the National Football League’s Denver Broncos (NFL).</p><p>Elway spent his entire 16-year professional career with the Denver Broncos while playing collegiate football for the Stanford Cardinal. He is frequently considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in history. Elway has the most victories of any starting quarterback at the time of his retirement in early 1999, and he was statistically the second-most effective passer in NFL history. He was one of just two players—the other being Thurman Thomas—and the only quarterback to score a running touchdown in four different Super Bowls. He was also a productive runner of the ball. In addition, Elway is just one of two quarterbacks (the other being Peyton Manning, who played for the Denver Broncos) to leave the game after winning the Super Bowl.</p><p>While at Stanford, Elway set numerous records for passing attempts and completions and was also named All-American. He was selected by the Baltimore Colts as the first pick in the 1983 NFL Draft, which is infamously known as the quarterback class of 1983, before being traded to the Denver Broncos. In the AFC Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns in January 1987, Elway participated in one of the most illustrious performances in sports and NFL history. This drive, which covered 98 yards and tied the game with a touchdown, became known as “The Drive.” Elway and the Broncos were defeated by the New York Giants in the Super Bowl XXI after that defeat in Cleveland.</p><p>The Broncos went through a period of decline following two consecutive Super Bowl defeats, but that was put to an end during the 1997 campaign when Elway and Denver earned their first Super Bowl championship by defeating the Green Bay Packers 31-24 in Super Bowl XXXII. The Denver Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34-19 in Super Bowl XXXIII to capture the title again the next year. Elway started five Super Bowls, which was a record at the time that was broken in February 2015 when Tom Brady of the New England Patriots started Super Bowl XLIX. Elway was named MVP of the Super Bowl, which was also his final game. Elway worked for the Broncos as general manager and executive vice president of football operations following his retirement as a player. During his time there, the team won four division championships, two AFC Championships, and Super Bowl 50. This made Elway a three-time Super Bowl champion with the team—two as a player and one as an executive. Elway was admitted to both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000 and 2004, respectively.</p><p>Jack Elway, who was then the head coach at Port Angeles High School, and Janet (née Jordan) Elway welcomed twins Elway and Jana into the world in Port Angeles, Washington. The sister Lee Ann, who was a year older than the twins, was part of the family of five. The following year, they relocated to Aberdeen, Washington, where Jack spent five seasons as the head football coach at Grays Harbor Community College, a junior college. When his father worked as an assistant coach at Montana and Washington State, respectively, Elway spent much of his early years in Missoula, Montana, and Pullman, Washington.</p><p>Jack joined the Palouse neighbor Idaho’s staff in February 1976, but a month later he was named the head coach of Division II Cal State-Northridge in Southern California. After John’s first year at Pullman High School, his family relocated to the San Fernando Valley, where he played football for the final three years at Granada Hills High School in Granada Hills, where he was coached by Tom Richards and Jack Neumeier. He finished his high school career with 5,711 throwing yards and 49 passing touchdowns despite missing five games due to a knee injury as a senior. He was selected to the PARADE All-America High School Football Team along with future NFL stars quarterback Dan Marino and running back Eric Dickerson.</p><p>He was one of the most highly sought-after high school players in the nation and was awarded multiple scholarships. He was known as a dual-threat quarterback, which meant that he was skilled at running and avoiding pressure with exceptional passing ability. His father, who succeeded him as San Jose State’s head coach after the 1978 campaign, made him one of those offers. Elway was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 18th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft and is a skilled baseball player as well. In the same selection, the Royals also selected Marino in round four.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is John Albert Elway?</h2><p>He is currently 62 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s John Albert Elway’s net worth?</h2><p>In 2022, the retired American football player’s estimated net worth will be $145 million. He also earns a $3 million salary each year. He earned almost $47 million in pay from the National Football League alone. He received tens of millions of dollars in endorsements while playing football.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s John Albert Elway’s height and weight?</h2><p>John is 6&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (1.91&nbsp;m) tall and weighs 215&nbsp;lb (98&nbsp;kg).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s John Albert Elway’s Nationality and Ethnicity?</h2><p>John is an American national.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What does John Albert Elway do for a living?</h2><p>In the “quarterback class of 1983” NFL Draft, the Baltimore Colts were selected first overall. Six quarterbacks were chosen in the first round, with Elway being the first. Elway was hesitant to suit up for the Colts, one of the league’s poorest teams at the time, and his father cautioned him against doing so because head coach Frank Kush was known for being a strict taskmaster. Baseball was at the time “a legitimate alternative” for Elway, despite the fact that he preferred football, according to his agent Marvin Demoff. Elway used the prospect as leverage when negotiating with the Colts.</p><p>Elway joined Denver as one of the most eagerly anticipated athletes in NFL history after being selected as one of the top quarterbacks. The “Elway Watch” section appeared in the neighborhood publications. The media anticipated that Elway might start at quarterback for the 1983 season after Herrmann was moved, and Craig Morton retired following the 1982 campaign. He made his NFL debut for the Denver Broncos in the season opener at Three Rivers Stadium against the Pittsburgh Steelers, where linebacker and fellow Hall of Famer Jack Lambert sacked him for the first time in his career.</p><p>Elway announced his retirement from professional football on May 2, 1999, at the age of 38. Elway is regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. At the time of his retirement, he was tied for the second-most quarterbacks to be selected to the Pro Bowl (nine), and he has one of the finest winning percentages in league history (148-82-1). Elway led the Broncos to victory in 14 of the 22 postseason games that he participated in with them, 21 of which he started. In those games, he completed 4,964 passes for 27, 27 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions. He also ran for 461 yards and another six touchdowns. He now ranks ninth overall in throwing yards, tenth overall in passes completed, and twelve overall in passing touchdowns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is John Albert Elway’s wife?</h2><p>While attending Stanford University, the two dated. After Janet received her Stanford degree, John Elway, who was then her companion and decided to get married in 1984.</p><p>There were very few guests invited to the wedding. Prior to their separation in 2002 and subsequent divorce in 2003, the couple had been married for roughly ten years.</p><p>The couple had two sons, Jordan and Jack, and two daughters, Juliana and Jessica, during their time together.</p><p>Although the reason for the divorce is not stated, some people feel that John’s busy schedule ultimately damaged their marriage.</p><p>John married Paige Green following the dissolution of his marriage to Janet Elway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqru8enZJqkkpq%2FtXnEpa6asV2XtrCz0ZqnobFdo7K1edaoqa2gXZius7HEq2Smp6KafA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html&text=Who%20is%20John%20Albert%20Elway%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20%26amp%3b%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html&title=Who%20is%20John%20Albert%20Elway%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html&title=Who%20is%20John%20Albert%20Elway%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html&title=Who%20is%20John%20Albert%20Elway%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html&description=Who%20is%20John%20Albert%20Elway%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-do-they-eat-on-love-island-and-when-are-meal-times.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  What do they eat on Love Island and when are meal times?
