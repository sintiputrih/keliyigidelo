He is best known all over the world for being a Swedish DJ under the names Pryda and Cirez D, who has released two studio albums, and a number of remixes, as well as his songs, such as the single “Call On Me” in 2004, which became a major hit. He is also recognized as a music producer, who runs three record labels – Pryda, Pryda Friends, and Mouseville. His career has been active since 1988.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Eric Prydz is, as of mid- 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Eric’s net worth is as high as $4.5 million, accumulating this amount of money through his successful career in the music industry as a DJ and music producer.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=eric-prydz-net-worth-45-million></span>Eric Prydz Net Worth $4.5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Eric Prydz has been producing music since the early 2000s, firstly under the name Eric Prydz, but he also released music under the names Pryda, Cirez D, and others. His career began to take a turn for the better in 2004, with the release of the song “Call On Me”, which became an international best-seller, as it topped the charts in several countries, including the UK, France, Australia and Germany. The song launched him further into music, and he started his own record label, The Pryda record label, and before long he launched his other two record labels, Pryda Friends and Mouseville. Little by little Eric became more and more involved in the music scene, and started collaborating with other DJs and musicians, including Axwell, Steve Angelo and Sebastian Ingrosso. He and other DJs started several projects; with Axwell he was a part of the duo Axer, and with Angelo he formed the A&P Project. These collaborations significantly increased the overall size of his net worth.<br>Eric`s debut album came out in 2012, entitled “Eric Prydz Presents Pryda”, however, the album wasn`t very well welcomed commercially, as it only reached No. 40 on the UK chart, and didn`t even entered the US Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>In 2016, Eric returned with his second studio album, entitled “Opus”, which reached No. 23 on the UK charts, and entered the US Billboard 200 chart at 164. Furthermore, it topped the US DanceElectronic Album chart, and UK Dance Albums chart. The album sales certainly increased his net worth by a large margin.<br>Some of his most popular songs, released under his pseudonyms, include “Deep Inside”, “Control Freak / Hoodpecker”, “Sunlight Dancing”, “Seashells”, “Full Stop”, “Generate”, “Layers”, “Breathe”, and “Rotonda”, among many others, all of which have increased his net worth to a large degree.</p><p>Furthermore, some of his remixes became extremely popular, including “Feel The Vibe”, originally performed by Axwell, then Duran Duran`s “Reach Up For The Sunrise”, “Thriller” by Michael Jackson, and songs by Depeche Mode, “Personal Jesus” and “Never Let Me Down Again”, among others, the popularity of which helped him increase further his net worth.</p><p>When it comes to speak about his personal life, there is no information about Eric Prydz in the media, except the fact that his current residence is in Los Angeles, California. In free time, he is active on his official Facebook page, where he has over 1 million fans.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Eric Prydz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4.5
