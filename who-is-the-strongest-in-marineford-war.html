In terms of strength, Roger was a true equal to Whitebeard and his biggest rival ever.</p><h2>Is Rocks D Xebec the strongest?</h2>Although Rocks' individual strength and abilities are unknown, he was well-reputed for presiding over a crew of extremely powerful pirates with clashing personalities and a lack of camaraderie, indicating that he was an extremely powerful and charismatic individual and possibly the strongest person of his time.<h2>Is Dragon stronger than Roger?</h2>Roger was an elite pirate who was a match for the likes of Whitebeard. Undoubtedly, Roger was stronger than Dragon.<h2>Can Rayleigh beat Kaido?</h2>Rayleigh is an old man now, but he is still strong enough to successfully clash with a Marine Admiral.
