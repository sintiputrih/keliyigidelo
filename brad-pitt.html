Brad Pitt is one of the most prominent and well-known names in Hollywood and other film industries. When it comes to action films, only a few names come to mind, and one of them is Brad Pitt. With the best action comes the best responsibility, and Mr. Pitt has retained his top rank in Hollywood acting.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Brad Pitt?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Brad Pit</a>t w as born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to trucking company owner William Alvin Pitt and school counselor Jane Etta. His family quickly relocated to Springfield, Missouri, where he resided with his younger siblings, Douglas Mitchell (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969). He was raised as a Southern Baptist and then “oscillated[d] between agnosticism and atheism” after being born into a fundamentalist Christian household. He later reconciled his spiritual ideas. Pitt grew up in Springfield, which he describes as “Mark Twain country, Jesse James country,” with “a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.”</p><p>Pitt went to Kickapoo High School and participated in the golf, swimming, and tennis teams. He was a member of the Key and Forensics clubs at school, as well as school debates and musicals. After graduating from high school in 1982, Pitt enrolled at the University of Missouri, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. Pitt was not ready to settle down as graduation approached. He enjoyed movies—”a portal into different worlds for me”—and, since they were not manufactured in Missouri, he wanted to go to where they were made.</p><p>Pitt left the university two weeks before finishing his degree courses and traveled to Los Angeles, where he took acting classes and worked odd jobs. He cites Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as early acting influences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many houses and cars does Brad Pitt have?</h2><p>Pitt Currently resides in Springfield, Missouri. Brad Pitt purchased this opulent residence in 2004. This Real Estate Property is estimated to be worth roughly $11.9 million.</p><p>Similarly, he has a sizable car collection. Brad Pitt owns several of the world’s most luxurious automobiles. Brad Pitt’s car brands include Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Range Rover, BMW, Audi, and Lamborghini.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Brad Pitt make per year?</h2><p><span>Pitt (Actor) earns a salary of $100,000,000.00 per year.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What investments does Brad Pitt have?</h2><p>Although he is not one of the most spectacular talents in this profession – there are many athletes, actors, and so on – he has managed to stand out many times with some of his efforts. One of them was a vineyard he had purchased with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie. Without a question, it was a wise investment.</p><p>Back in the day, the pair spent a total of 29 million dollars to acquire the property. Angelina sold her stake (about 40%) in the company after the divorce for 164 million dollars. The actress has made a tidy profit, while Pitt is still making the most of it.</p><p>So much so that this vineyard in France, which employs grapes cultivated at Chateau Mirval, is related to his most recent investment. It is a new line of cosmetics for neutral skin. According to an interview with Vogue magazine, he has dubbed it Le Domaine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Endorsement deals does Brad Pitt have?</h2><p>William Bradley Pitt, the award-winning celebrity, film producer, and style icon, is one of today’s most in-demand actors, not just for films, but also for luxury brand endorsements. The American actor has supported twelve different businesses, ranging from fashion to automobiles to alcohol.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many Philanthropy works has Brad Pitt supported?</h2><p>Pitt, a man of many abilities, has a keen interest in architecture, particularly in global efforts to develop environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. This prompted him to organize a group of specialists in New Orleans to explore large-scale green, affordable housing construction to assist those families most in need following Hurricane Katrina’s devastation. That same group is now formally known as The Make It Right Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to financing and building 150 new houses in New Orleans’ Ninth Ward, rebuilding lives and communities with a focus on sustainability and affordability.</p><p>The first six residences were finished in October 2008. Pitt met with US President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in March 2009, proposing his vision of “green housing” as a national model and discussing the possibility of public assistance.</p><p>Pitt won an award from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in the design, construction, and operation of buildings, in September 2009, in honor of the green housing idea employed for the Make It Right foundation.</p><p>His consistent devotion to humanitarian issues around the world has led him to demonstrate his heart by donating time and resources to numerous charities. According to tax records, Pitt and Angelina Jolie donated more than $8 million to charity in 2006.</p><p>Also, Pitt and Jolie traveled to Pakistan in November 2005 to examine the aftermath of the Kashmir earthquake. They flew to Haiti the following year to visit a school supported by The Yéle Hati Foundation, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician Wyclef Jean that uses music, sports, and the media to reinforce projects that are making a difference in education, health, the environment, and community development. Pitt and Jolie donated to three aid organizations in Chad and Darfur affected by the Darfur crisis in May 2007.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpupmpxdpba1wI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrad-pitt.html&text=What%20is%20Brad%20Pitts%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrad-pitt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-pitt.html&title=What%20is%20Brad%20Pitts%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrad-pitt.html&title=What%20is%20Brad%20Pitts%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-pitt.html&title=What%20is%20Brad%20Pitts%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrad-pitt.html&description=What%20is%20Brad%20Pitts%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%20%26amp%3b%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-john-albert-elway-biography-net-worth-career-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is John Albert Elway: Biography, Net Worth, Career, &amp;amp; more">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ross-mechanic-net-worth-181463.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ross Mechanic Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
