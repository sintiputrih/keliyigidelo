Robbie signed up for the competition along with 10 other contestants which premiered on 6 January. To celebrate his appearance he and his friends threw a premier party at&nbsp;Bellefonte Brewing Co.’s North Wilmington.</p><p>The chefs on “Pressure Cooker” live together and compete against one another, just like “Top Chef” on Bravo and “Hell’s Kitchen.” Contrary to such programs, there is a “Survivor”-style component in which the competitors judge one another. The prize is a cool $100,000, and winning calls for talent and a clever plan that makes use of alliances.</p><p>Discover about Robbie’s wife, parents, age, and more from this article.</p><h3><strong>Meet Robbie Jester, The Winner Of Netflix’s Pressure Cooker Season 1</strong></h3><p>“It’s a mix between&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;and&nbsp;Top Chef where we’re all in a house, living together, brushing our teeth next to each other, and we’re also cooking in a cooking competition that changes daily,” Robbie said about the show. “We have the social element of&nbsp;Big Brother, there are no celebrity chefs, and there’s no judge living in the house with us. We are the judges.”</p><p>“That competition gives you a barometer for where you are professional, where your strengths are, where your weaknesses are, and if you allow it to it teaches you a lot about yourself and where you need to grow and learn,” Robbie added.</p><p>It’s not just about entertainment for foodies, according to Robbie, who boasts a cabinet full of competitive cookery programs.</p><p>“From the instructional portion of it people that are into cooking itself, and not just into food, they can watch it and learn something,” said Robbie. “Chefs are competitive, especially any that aspire to achieve on any sort of higher level, for any sort of award or notoriety, I think we’re super competitive.”</p><p>But, Robbie certainly had an upper hand in the competition as he had appeared on Food Network’s Beat Bobby Flay where he beat the celebrity chef with his shrimp scampi dish. He also competed in Guy’s Grocery Games and lost during the first appearance but came back and won the second.</p><p>Regarding his appearance, Mike won the Monochromatic Challenge in the semifinals and had to decide who to choose as his opponent for the finals. Robbie was the person he decided since he appreciated the latter’s work in the kitchen and believed that some of his skills just could not be taught. One of the contestants that were eliminated joined the two cooks in the finals as their sous-chef.</p><p>Robbie initially wanted Lana, but after hearing Mike say he wanted Lana to be his partner, he chose to go with his good friend Ed. The votes were cast when the finalists served their delectable selection of meals to the other competitors, who served as judges, and Robbie won with 5 votes to Mike’s 4.</p><h3><strong>Robbie Jester Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Robbie Jester’s estimated net worth exceeds $350 thousand. He discovered his love for cooking growing up in his father’s restaurant and by the time when he turned 12, he was helping out at Harbor House, his family’s Worton, Maryland, restaurant. Three years later, he was running the line.</p><p>Robbie also worked at restaurants like Toscana, the Hotel du Pont, Stone Balloon, and Limestone BBQ + Bourbon. Numerous magazines, including Delaware Today Magazine, Brandywine Signature Magazine, Out and About, and the News Journal, have published his art. From 2012 to 2014, Robbie also had the distinction of being named one of the “Best Chefs of America” for the state of Delaware.</p><p>Robbie was selected by the Delaware Business Times as one of the top 40 leaders under 40 and by the Delaware Restaurant Association as a Rising Star.</p><p>As of 2022, Robbie is the owner of Pizzeria Mariana in Newark and also In Jest Events, a private chef and event company.</p><p>Robbie is a graduate of The Culinary Institute of America. He studied HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY at Delaware Technical and Community College.</p><h3><strong>Is Robbie Jester Married?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Robbie Jester is married to his long-time girlfriend turned wife <a href=#>Katelyn Jester</a>. According to their registry on <a href=#>The Knot</a>, the couple exchanged their wedding vows on 7 October 2022 and they have a dating app to thank for bringing them together.</p><p>According to their wedding website, their story read: “It was a warm July evening of scrolling and swiping when Robbie and Katelyn came across each other’s profiles. While many stories begin with Love-at-first-swipe, this was not the case. After funny exchanges and some borrowed pick-up lines, Katelyn agreed to a first date.”</p><p>Robbie had an awful time and was in a dilemma about whether or not to even meet his future wife. Their story reads: “He did it anyway and met someone that was able to pull him out of his shell despite his difficult day. Katelyn was funny and charming, (slightly intoxicated) and made it an enjoyable evening.”</p><p>Katelyn made the chef wait for the second date. They finally scheduled their second date at Redfire.</p><p>She invited him to get out with friends after supper. He realized he was in. With subtlety, grace, and a mouthful of Fritos, Katelyn went in for the first kiss after a few more beers. It made Robbie giggle and continued their developing connection despite the taste of corn chips. Their relationship got serious over the years.</p><p>Robbie proposed on 6 March 2022 and invited friends and family for the beautiful moment.</p><p>The couple doesn’t share any children as of this writing but is parents to three adorable pups.</p><p>Talking about Katelyn is from <span class=xt0psk2>Bear, Delaware (nee Davis).</span></p><h3><strong>Robbie Jester Age</strong></h3><p>In January 2023, Robbie Jester is 37 years old.
