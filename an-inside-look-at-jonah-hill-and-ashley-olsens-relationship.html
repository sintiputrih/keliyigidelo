This is especially true of the ones that seem so outlandish or somewhat unlikely.</p><p>For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">did you have any idea that Kristen Stewart is friendly with Kanye West?</a> What about Justin Bieber and Jennifer Aniston? Or Howard Stern's relationship with his former enemy, Rosie O'Donnell?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone tends to know about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the close relationship between Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. However, that's due to all of the press they did when promoting Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wallstreet. But did you know about Jonah Hill's friendship with Ashley Olsen?</p><p>Yes... THAT Ashley Olsen.</p><p>Ashley, of Mary-Kate and Ashley, Olsen.</p><h2 id=jonah-was-first-spotted-with-mary-kate-not-ashley>Jonah Was First Spotted With Mary-Kate, Not Ashley</h2><p>According to W Magazine, the world first found out about Jonah's bond with the Olsen Twins back in 2015, when Mary-Kate and her then-husband Olivier Sarkozy were seen hugging Jonah in New York City. A couple of years later, Ashley was seen doing the same. And it's usually her that Jonah is spotted with.</p><p>While celebrity friendships are usually not worth hiding, Jonah has certainly kept his relationship with Ashley Olsen on the down-low, along with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an assortment of other revealing facts about his life</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-friendship-began-when-they-were-coming-up-in-hollywood-together>Their Friendship Began When They Were Coming Up In Hollywood Together</h2><p>The origin of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah's relationship with both Ashley and Mary-Kate</a> isn't all that surprising. They were all famous young people working in the industry in Los Angeles during the exact same time.</p><p>Up-and-coming actors tend to gravitate toward one another since they're all going through an extremely unique situation. Although to be fair, Ashley and Mary-Kate were hugely successful at that time. While the majority of their Hollywood success came when they were child-stars in their various movies and on Full House, The Olsens also had television shows when they were teenagers. Jonah, on the other hand, was just starting out. He didn't get his breakthrough roles until 2007's Knocked Up and Superbad.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Pics Of Jonah Hill And Channing Tatum That Show Their True Bromance</a></span></p><h2 id=jonah-s-style-game-has-been-upped-by-ashley>Jonah's Style Game Has Been Upped By Ashley</h2><p>Since their days in Hollywood, Jonah has been seen hanging out with Ashley in New York. Given Ashley's influence in the fashion industry, Jonah seems to step-up his outfit game whenever he's with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this appears to shock the paparazzi who think that the famous pair are mismatched. Part of that may have to do with the fact that Ashley does her best to stay away from social media and the limelight. She's intensely private and therefore doesn't want to be spotted with anyone from her personal life, according to The Daily Mail.</p><p>Jonah, on the other hand, isn't afraid of the press. He's almost always out and about with his celebrity pals, whether he's at dinner with Channing Tatum or watching a basketball game at Madison Square Garden with his high-school bro, Adam Levine.</p><h2 id=ashley-has-been-there-for-jonah-during-his-darkest-days>Ashley Has Been There For Jonah During His Darkest Days</h2><p>Most famously, Ashley and Jonah were spotted together during Easter 2018. While their stroll through New York's Lower East Side looked casual enough, it might have meant more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jonah's brother, Jordan Feldstein, passed away a few months prior due to a heart attack. Jonah, who was obviously distraught, had barely been seen since. Ashley's visit may have been about offering her condolences to him. Or, at the very least, she was there to give him some sort of sense of normalcy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Quit Acting: Hereâ€™s What Theyâ€™ve Been Doing Instead</a></span></p><h2 id=jonah-couldn-t-let-winning-an-award-take-away-from-a-chance-to-praise-ashley>Jonah Couldn't Let Winning An Award Take Away From A Chance To Praise Ashley</h2><p>But Ashley is also there to support Jonah during the good times. According to People, she and her sister, Mary-Kate, attended The Wall Street Journal's 2018 Innovator Awards where Jonah was being honored with the film award. The event was held at the Museum of Modern Art right in the heart of Manhattan, New York. Ashley and Mary-Kate even sat right next to Jonah at his table when he received the prestigious honor.</p><p>In all likelihood, he had invited them to share in this joyous occasion. This is a huge deal for the twins, as they rarely appear at the same venue in order to break away from the "Olsen Twin" image that plagued their childhood. So, it tells us just how important Jonah is to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This respect is clearly reciprocated as Jonah made the point to honor the Olsen Twins in his Innovator Awards acceptance speech. He claimed that he has been inspired by them since they were all kids together in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Major Celebrities We Totally Forgot Were In Mary-Kate & Ashley Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=their-connection-remains-shrouded-in-mystery>Their Connection Remains Shrouded In Mystery</h2><p>While some of Jonah's other celebrity friendships are highly publicized, it's nice that he has one that we know barely anything about. It tells us that there's some true authenticity to it. That it means something to him beyond the perks of publicity.</p><p>And the same goes for Ashley, who has remained out of the public eye for years. While she could easily be ridding Jonah's growing coattails, she chooses to keep her platonic love for him between them. That must mean the world to him given how likely it is that people attempt to use his fame for their own selfish desires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the day, Jonah Hill and Ashley Olsen's friendship is still very much a mystery and that's exactly how they'd like to keep it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ASAP Rocky & Jonah Hill Are Reviving The Tie Dye In Menâ€™s Fashion</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnJqKWaoF2dtq24jJqlnWWRqLWtsdhmpqWrlaPAbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-jonah-hill-and-ashley-olsens-relationship.html&text=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Jonah%20Hill%20And%20Ashley%20Olsen%27s%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fan-inside-look-at-jonah-hill-and-ashley-olsens-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-jonah-hill-and-ashley-olsens-relationship.html&title=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Jonah%20Hill%20And%20Ashley%20Olsen%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-jonah-hill-and-ashley-olsens-relationship.html&title=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Jonah%20Hill%20And%20Ashley%20Olsen%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-jonah-hill-and-ashley-olsens-relationship.html&title=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Jonah%20Hill%20And%20Ashley%20Olsen%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-jonah-hill-and-ashley-olsens-relationship.html&description=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Jonah%20Hill%20And%20Ashley%20Olsen%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jared-vaughn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Florida Man Arrested After Genealogy Website Links Him to 2007 Rape">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-ushers-girlfriend-everything-there-is-to-know-about-jenn-goicoechea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Usher's new wife?
