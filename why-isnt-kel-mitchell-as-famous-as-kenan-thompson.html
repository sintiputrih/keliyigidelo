He's been on the show since 2003 and broken a handful of records on stage and off. But fans may not know that around the time he was pushing to join the cast (at first he was told he was too young), Kel Mitchell was giving it a go, too.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sources say</a> that both comedians tried out for 'Saturday Night Live' in 2003, but only one of them received a job offer. Kel doesn't seem to hold a grudge against his long-ago co-star, though (and they're working together again these days).</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-kel-mitchell-stay-in-the-spotlight>Why Didn't Kel Mitchell Stay In The Spotlight?</h2><p>In an interview, he explained that after 'Kenan & Kel' ended, he continued with acting gigs as usual.

He's&nbsp;still acting today, and fans can catch him on shows like 'Game Shakers'&nbsp;and co-producing a new iteration of 'All That'&nbsp;with Kenan.</p><p>And he doesn't mind being remembered for such gigs, either -- even Kel's family quotes his old characters' lines and catchphrases to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kel-has-a-family-and-another-generation-of-comedic-relief>Kel Has A Family (And Another Generation Of Comedic Relief)</h2><p>One family member that especially loves Kel's comedic past is his son.
