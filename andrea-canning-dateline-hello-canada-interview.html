Not to worry, though – we can tell Andrea is one of those people who rolls out of bed looking effortlessly camera-ready, just like the characters in her favourite 1990s show, Melrose Place (these days, she has <strong>Heather Locklear</strong> on speed dial).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d90486cc93c-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=ezN2VP73ftEE data-wc=6>Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO!

She and her husband of 11 years, Lt.-Col. <strong>George Anthony “Tony” Bancroft</strong> of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, are parents to <strong>Anna</strong>, 10, <strong>Charlie</strong>, 9, <strong>Kiki</strong>, 7, <strong>Georgia</strong>, 5, <strong>Elle</strong>, 4, and three-month-old <strong>George, Jr. </strong>– a.k.a. <strong>Tripp</strong> (their only son, conceived via IVF). And although they’re model children, they’re also, well, kids. Shortly before our photo shoot, in fact, tiny Elle took scissors to her own hair! Andrea and Tony take it all in stride.</p><p id=exY-nVPZh4jS data-wc=21>“It’s a lot of work, but we don’t care. We love it,” she says. “Our motto is, ‘Just roll with it.’”</p><h2>FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN TO BAYWATCH</h2><p id=eHO2tP3xUGY9 data-wc=54>Perhaps it’s her upbringing in the peaceful atmosphere of Ontario’s Blue Mountain that has infused Andrea with her laid-back attitude. She and Tony – who live in Westchester County, N.Y. – couldn’t be more welcoming as we arrive to photograph the whole family at her Canadian childhood home on a breezy late summer’s day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/04eba1293039-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eZh4n4sxe7LK data-wc=21>The girls, who attend public school in Westchester, N.Y., love their second home in Canada. Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=e6-qooKHuEvO data-wc=53>The six-bedroom Scandinavian-style house, owned by her father, <strong>Gordon</strong>, is where Andrea was born and raised – close to the picturesque ski and golf resort that was, incredibly, founded by her maternal grandparents, <strong>Jozo and <strong>Helen Weider</strong>. Her mother, <strong>Katherine</strong> </strong>(who heartbreakingly passed away of cancer in 2007), was a downhill ski champion.</p><p id=eJ9_qkisPAoa data-wc=9>“She was an incredible racer,” her daughter says wistfully.</p><p id=eWzXQ7FBXwE1 data-wc=20>Continuing on her mom’s competitive spirit, little Andrea grew up “skiing, playing tennis, boating, mountain biking – you name it.”</p><p id=eWd7_5wYUXUv data-wc=70>Her athletic pursuits took a back seat as her vocational endeavours took over. Always interested in what makes people tick, Andrea graduated in psychology from the University of Western Ontario, then studied radio and television arts at Toronto-based Ryerson University before taking herself off to Hollywood for an internship at Baywatch - a gig that saw her become a professional assistant and nanny for <span><strong>David Hasselhoff</strong></span><span></span> and his first wife.</p><p id=evZVQudFjiaY data-wc=9>“He’s extremely generous and very, very funny,” she says.</p><p id=e3JPAdB1K3UJ data-wc=5>She also roomed with <a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>!</p><p id=eE_lpRRkVKlB data-wc=53>Working her way up the career ladder, Andrea landed stints at ABC News, Good Morning America and the Today show. Her surprise break, though, came in 2011 with a 20/20 <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> interview that saw her tackle the controversial Hollywood star on issues ranging from drug use to his rift with his famous father, <a class=hm-link href=#>Martin Sheen</a>.</p><p id=eYorttSQCfEE data-wc=7>“It was my biggest ever,” she says.</p><p id=el4e5X6_UUUK data-wc=9>The video went viral and Dateline called shortly thereafter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee91263aad9b-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eejGyAkiS_-K data-wc=6>Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=eyz0qk25DKd3 data-wc=70>Amid the dream gigs and a life of perpetual travel, Andrea also managed to meet the man of her dreams, U.S. fighter pilot Tony, 44, through her foreign-affairs correspondent friend <strong>Martha Raddatz</strong>, whom he met while stationed in Iraq. The couple started out as pen pals. Tying the knot two years later in 2008, they quickly had baby Anna, now 10, whom they introduced in the pages of Hello! Canada.</p><p id=ekBDC8lRE0FA data-wc=27>“We didn’t know what we were doing!” says a smiling Tony (who now works as a financial advisor for investment mogul <strong>Mario Gabelli</strong>), reflecting on first-time parenthood.</p><p id=e4dCyns12buF data-wc=23>“Just clueless!” chimes in Andrea. “There were some easier years in the middle and now with six, it’s like we’re back to chaos.”</p><p id=eTc8IoWGuTk6 data-wc=13>“We wanted to plan a babymoon,” adds Tony, joking: “But she got pregnant!”</p><p id=eSTQ_i8XVLou data-wc=26>Andrea chatted with <strong>HELLO! Canada</strong> about everything from what it’s like raising six kids to her thoughts on <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess Meghan</a> and what she misses most about Canada.</p><p id=eMitisMHLb8w data-wc=32><strong>HELLO! Canada: Andrea, when we last caught up with you, you just had one child. Now you have six! As an only child yourself, did you ever envision such a large family?</strong></p><p id=eGvSSlJJDGQ5 data-wc=64>Absolutely not. [In fact] I was fearful that I wouldn’t be able to have even one. Tony was in the military when we got married and I was like “I’m getting older and you’re in the military.” I was freaking out a little bit because we weren’t even living in the same city at first. But lo and behold, we had a honeymoon baby!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94a9c9f3b424-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eGD0BtQ73RFw data-wc=28>"We have built-in baby sitters," Andrea jokes of her five little helpers.

Canada</p><p id=eEE1zMDWqTpF data-wc=7><strong>And pretty soon you had five girls.</strong></p><p id=eYUyAa59sMwU data-wc=21>It was amazing. [After Elle’s birth] I was like, “Wow, we were able to have a fifth. Who would have thought?”</p><p id=emjdII1q7nJp data-wc=6><strong>But then you wanted a boy…</strong></p><p id=e-YW9Q2JiuY1 data-wc=73>That’s when we did IVF, yeah. Just to be clear, though, we didn’t do IVF specifically to have a boy. We knew we just wanted to have one more and if it was a boy, wonderful, and if it was a girl, we were still going to have another one. We did the genetic testing for health reasons and the boy was the higher-quality embryo. So we had one chance, and it worked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/589cf4fa4c86-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=ewby0ySu-H2H data-wc=56>Andrea says heroic Tony is the one who gets out of bed for Tripp’s nightly feeds. While the couple would have been just as thrilled with a sixth girl, she says having a baby boy was ‘meant to be’ – the male embryo was more viable for transfer during IVF. Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=egcatW-at1k2 data-wc=8><strong>Was the IVF really tough on you physically?</strong></p><p id=eQGofu-kvhSt data-wc=66>At times it was. And especially trying to juggle my job, travelling and not telling anybody at work what I was doing. Everyone [at work] just expects you to be free and get on a plane. “We have to do this now!” And I’m like, “I can’t.” And it’s like, “Well, why not?” So that got stressful, just kind of dancing around what I was doing.</p><p id=e5mFJDxSzKg- data-wc=6><strong>So you and yourfriends watched it?</strong></p><p id=ecfi0sxseYEu data-wc=61>Yes, we all watched it! And I remember meeting him rightafter. It was Thanksgiving. I met him at the hotel he was staying at in Maryland.I walked in and he had on his pilot jacket and he was standing at the fireplacewith his back to me. And he turned around and I swear it was out of Top Gun or something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da8b1d58190e-body35-z.jpg><p class=caption id=ezSpzmfHR3jT data-wc=6>Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO!

And I had met military men before through work. Butnot anybody that I knew really well. I wasn’t surprised – I guess I just neverreally thought about it.

Do you want me to quit my job?” “No, you have a cool job.” Well, all butone [said that].

The sound bite ended with Charlie on theradio saying, “Why doesn’t anybody get me?” I looked over at [co-anchor] <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> and I said, “Yeah,why doesn’t anybody get him?” Like, sarcastically. I was laughing. And Iremember thinking to myself, “If only I had his cell number, I bet I couldconvince him to do the interview.” But I forgot about it. I don’t have his cellnumber. So I go back to my office, my phone rings, and it’s Charlie’spublicist. And he says, “Would you be able to talk to Charlie?” So Charliecalled me and he said, “You know what? You’re the first person to laugh in agood way about me. I can tell you didn’t take me too seriously. Let’s keeptalking.” He just happened to catch the segment. Ten days later, I did theinterview.

But now, it’s like people arepicking apart everything she does. I don’t envy her – I mean, yes, it’s greatto be a princess, but also you’re really under the white-hot spotlight, andthat’s tough. People are comparing her with Diana. With Kate, [she and William]just quietly started this relationship in college.
