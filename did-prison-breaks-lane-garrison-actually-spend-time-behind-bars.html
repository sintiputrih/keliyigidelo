One of the main reasons that the show was so popular with fans was its unique and compelling premise, which involved two brothers working together to uncover a conspiracy and free one of them from prison.This high-stakes and dramatic plot kept viewers on the edge of their seats and invested in the characters and their journey.Another factor that made Prison Break so adored by audiences was the strong performances of the cast, particularly <a href=#>Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield</a> and <a href=#>Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows</a>. The chemistry between the two actors added depth to their characters and made their relationship as brothers feel authentic and compelling.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is 'Prison Break' Star Wentworth Miller's Longtime Rumored Boyfriend, Luke Macfarlane?</a></span>Additionally, the show had a strong supporting cast, and featured a number of memorable and well-developed secondary characters, such as Sara Tancredi, portrayed by <a href=#>The Walking Dead’s Sarah Wayne Callies</a>, as well as the likes of Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) and T-Bag (Robert Knepper).Another actor who played an important role in the series was Lane Garrison, who is also known for his work in Camp X-Ray, Bonnie & Clyde and From Dusk till Dawn: The Series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-role-did-lane-garrison-play-in-prison-break>What Role Did Lane Garrison Play In Prison Break?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lane-garrison-prison-break.jpg><p>Lane Garrison featured in Prison Break as David “Tweener” Apolskis, a young and inexperienced inmate at <a href=#>the fictional Fox River State Penitentiary</a>, who becomes involved with the main characters as they attempt to escape from the prison. Despite his naivety and lack of street smarts, Tweener proves to be a valuable member of the group and plays a key role in their efforts to escape.</p><p>Garrison's portrayal of Tweener was praised by critics and fans alike, for his ability to convey the character’s vulnerability and naivety, while also portraying his growth and development throughout the series. In particular, his ultimate depiction of Tweener's loyalty to the group and his willingness to risk his own safety for the greater good was widely praised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Dominic Purcell's Net Worth Since 'Prison Break'</a></span></p><p>Although the character Tweener probably remains to be Garrison’s most iconic role to date, the actor hasn’t often spoken up about his time working on the famous Fox series. He did reveal his excitement when <a href=#>a one-season revival</a> was announced in June 2015.</p><p>“I can’t wait to see the guys back at it. All of them are good friends of mine and it will be great. I don’t know the premise yet but maybe they can bring Tweener back from the dead,” Garrison teased.</p><h2 id=lane-garrison-was-also-incarcerated-in-real-life>Lane Garrison Was Also Incarcerated In Real Life</h2><p>Having played a convict on Prison Break in 2005 and 2006, Lane Garrison would soon find himself behind bars in real life. On December 2, 2006, the actor was driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs when he crashed his vehicle into a tree in Beverly Hills, California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The crash resulted in the death of a 17-year-old passenger, Vahagn Setian, and serious injuries to two other passengers.</p><p>Garrison was charged with vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence, causing injury. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 2007 and was <a href=#>sentenced to 40 months in prison</a>. He was released in April 2009, after serving 27 months of his sentence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>11 Stars We Forget Did Time In Prison</a></span></p><p>In the years following his release, Garrison has spoken publicly about the incident and his time in prison, expressing remorse for his actions and advocating for alcohol and drug education and rehabilitation programs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Texas-born star’s real-life incarceration would become a cautionary tale about the dangers of drunk-driving and the serious consequences that can result from such actions.</p><h2 id=how-did-lane-garrison-feel-about-going-to-jail>How Did Lane Garrison Feel About Going To Jail?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lane-garrison.jpg><p>Years before Matt Lauer fell from grace as host of TODAY on NBC, <a href=#>Lane Garrison sat down for an interview</a> with the longtime newsman. The actor bore his soul about his experience of going to prison in real life, and the lessons he hoped other people would learn from his mistakes.</p><p>“I wish I could have talked a little bit more about what life was like inside prison so that people could understand the consequences of their actions. Really see what’s going on inside of a prison, inside of a jail — which obviously I put myself in,” Garrison said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Waking up in a cell covered in ants and roaches... Being tortured by guards... Not having anything but four walls,” he continued.</p><p>“One of the things about jail that’s weird is that you’re sent to a place where you’re supposed to sit there and think about your actions and their consequences and why you’re there. And I think now, it turns more into — the minute you go there, it’s just survival.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpb%2Bqv86nZJuqlZa4tHnLmqWeZZeWv7O10qilZpmTqcKiuMuyZKyolaOxbsDIppxmmpWdtq%2BwjJuYq6tf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-prison-breaks-lane-garrison-actually-spend-time-behind-bars.html&text=Did%20Prison%20Break%27s%20Lane%20Garrison%20Actually%20Spend%20Time%20Behind%20Bars%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-prison-breaks-lane-garrison-actually-spend-time-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-prison-breaks-lane-garrison-actually-spend-time-behind-bars.html&title=Did%20Prison%20Break%27s%20Lane%20Garrison%20Actually%20Spend%20Time%20Behind%20Bars%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-prison-breaks-lane-garrison-actually-spend-time-behind-bars.html&title=Did%20Prison%20Break%27s%20Lane%20Garrison%20Actually%20Spend%20Time%20Behind%20Bars%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-prison-breaks-lane-garrison-actually-spend-time-behind-bars.html&title=Did%20Prison%20Break%27s%20Lane%20Garrison%20Actually%20Spend%20Time%20Behind%20Bars%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-prison-breaks-lane-garrison-actually-spend-time-behind-bars.html&description=Did%20Prison%20Break%27s%20Lane%20Garrison%20Actually%20Spend%20Time%20Behind%20Bars%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-msi-ge75-raider-laptop-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Final Words - The MSI GE75 Raider Laptop Review: Core i9 and RTX 2080 Performance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./diane-bish-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-shoes-facts-and-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diane Bish Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Shoes , Facts, and Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
