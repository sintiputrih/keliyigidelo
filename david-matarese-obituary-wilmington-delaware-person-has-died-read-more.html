When he passed away, his loved ones were by his side as well. His birthplace is Warwick, Rhode Island, and he entered this world on October 26, 1951. He was born after his parents, Everdene McCall and Giuseppe Matarese, had both died. He leaves behind a large extended family, including his cherished wife, Theresa A. Matarese, his children, Bridget Moore, Joshua, Jesse, and Samantha, as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and grandchildren.</p><p>A large number of grandchildren are also left behind by him. His parents, Guiseppe Matarese and Everdene McCall, had already died before he was born. Joseph had many happy years working as an engineer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, before finally retiring. He cherished his wonderful family, his beautiful wife, and God beyond all else. He highly valued this relationship as a devoted follower of Christ. He had many interests during his long and fruitful life, and playing cards, especially cribbage, was one of them. It was a long and fruitful life for this man.</p><p>Along with that, he loved being a ball buster, going to church, visiting the beach, being near the water, sipping coffee, and eating sweets. Being a papa, though, was what he loved most. His skills were unmatched. You can’t put a price on his significance; he was the driving force behind everything they achieved. On Friday, September 29, 2023, from six o’clock until eight o’clock, friends and family can gather at McMillan-Small Funeral Home to meet and greet family members.</p><p>The McMillan-Small Funeral Home is scheduled to host a Christian ceremony on Saturday, September 30, 2023, beginning at 10:00 AM. We still haven’t decided when the event will be. The host family has asked that everyone attend in red, whether it’s for Captain America or Marvel-themed attire. Everyone involved is cordially asked to fulfill this request. The family would prefer that you consider donating to a charity or his church instead of sending flowers. I appreciate you taking the time to think about this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMCvoJ1lnZbBor7ErJxmp5Kewbat0bJksKGcoravs9OopWaclaGuuK3RnmSpnaKovK95x5qqZpyZmrFuvsSam2aln6eycA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-matarese-obituary-wilmington-delaware-person-has-died-read-more.html&text=David%20Matarese%20Obituary%2c%20Wilmington%20Delaware%20Person%20Has%20Died%2c%20Read%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-matarese-obituary-wilmington-delaware-person-has-died-read-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-matarese-obituary-wilmington-delaware-person-has-died-read-more.html&title=David%20Matarese%20Obituary%2c%20Wilmington%20Delaware%20Person%20Has%20Died%2c%20Read%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-matarese-obituary-wilmington-delaware-person-has-died-read-more.html&title=David%20Matarese%20Obituary%2c%20Wilmington%20Delaware%20Person%20Has%20Died%2c%20Read%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-matarese-obituary-wilmington-delaware-person-has-died-read-more.html&title=David%20Matarese%20Obituary%2c%20Wilmington%20Delaware%20Person%20Has%20Died%2c%20Read%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-matarese-obituary-wilmington-delaware-person-has-died-read-more.html&description=David%20Matarese%20Obituary%2c%20Wilmington%20Delaware%20Person%20Has%20Died%2c%20Read%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-beasley-dead-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fan-Favorite Actor John Beasley Dead At 79">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./three-sci-fi-movies-to-watch-if-you-like-no-one-is-going-to-save-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="3 sci-fi movies to watch if you like No One is Going to Save You">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
