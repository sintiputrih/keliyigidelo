Even though the show ended back in 2013, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are still as tight as ever and have been working together on various projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Fatherhood Changed Aaron Paul's Career</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The moment I met Bryan, I instantly fell in love with the man</a>," Paul said while delivering a moving speech at his friend's Hollywood Walk of Fame star acceptance. "I mean, how could you not? He's charming, he's brilliant, and he's a beautiful human being inside and out who is constantly running around in his underwear making people laugh."</p><p>With that being said, there is still a lot to be said about this beautiful friendship. To sum it up, here's a look into Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's friendship in real life.</p><h2 id=how-bryan-cranston-and-aaron-paul-met><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Bryan Cranston And Aaron Paul Met</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul starred as an unlikely drug manufacturing duo, Walter White (a high school chemistry teacher) and Jesse Pinkman (Walt's former student and an addict) in Breaking Bad, which aired on January 20th, 2008.</p><p>Little did they know that they were up against some TV heavyweights before landing the role: Aaron was up against Gossip Girl and You star Penn Badgley, and the original name of his character was Marion Alan, and AMC executives wanted Ferris Bueller actor Matthew Broderick to play the character.</p><h2 id=aaron-paul-39-s-character-was-destined-to-be-written-off-in-the-first-seasons-of-breaking-bad><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Aaron Paul's Character Was Destined To Be Written Off In The First Seasons Of Breaking Bad</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaron Paul's character, Jesse, ended up surviving the whole five seasons alive - even got his own movie El Camino, but between 2007 and 2008, showrunner Vince Gilligan almost considered axing him. The original storyline would revolve around Jesse's death and how Walt evolved into Heisenberg as a way to cope with the loss, but the actor did an astounding job to convince everyone that he deserved to stay. Bryan, however, would go on to make pranks into thinking that Jesse would be killed off soon.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He would say, 'Hey, did you read the next script?</a>'" the Need for Speed actor recalled in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. "And I'd go, 'Nah, did you get it?' And he's like, 'Oh.'

It gives Aaron's character closure and a well-deserved send-off after everything he's gone through throughout the five seasons.</p><p>The duo returned in a flashback scene, which was filmed back in January 2019 when Bryan had 36 hours break from his Broadway hit Network.
