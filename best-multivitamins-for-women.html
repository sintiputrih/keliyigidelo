Each one is designed to provide nutrients that you might not get enough of from your diet alone," explains nutritionist Riya.</p><p id=eXwt3kocog data-wc=97>"Our bodies require a diverse array of vitamins and minerals to function optimally. When our diet falls short in providing these essential nutrients, multivitamins can step in to fill the gap. They help ensure that your body gets the right amounts of nutrients like Vitamin D, which supports bone health, or Vitamin B12, essential for energy production. Additionally, minerals like Zinc, Selenium, and Potassium play crucial roles in everything from immune function to heart health.In essence, multivitamins act as a safety net, making sure you get the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support your overall well-being."</p><p id=e4S9LNbDsX data-wc=33>Dr Vijay adds: &nbsp;"Multivitamins represent more than just a remedy for overt deficiencies—they are a proactive strategy to safeguard against the nuances of modern living, ensuring that individuals maintain optimal health and vitality."</p><p id=eyri6hL0jn4 data-wc=62>"Multivitamins are indispensable in today's fast-paced world where dietary constraints and lifestyle factors often lead to nutritional insufficiencies. While overt deficiencies garner attention, it's the subtle gaps in nutrient intake that multivitamins effectively address. This is exemplified in research such as the JAMA study, which highlights their role in reducing cancer risks among older men, emphasising the criticality of consistent nutrient intake."</p><h2 dir=ltr>How we chose the best multivitamins</h2><p id=enatkrjPcDu data-wc=93>As well as getting expert advice and recommendations from Dr Vijay and nutritionist Riya Lakhani-Kanji, (scroll down for more information about our experts and why you should trust them) we also consulted the team of <strong>HELLO!&nbsp;</strong>Online shopping experts to find out their favourite products and brands - we don’t recommend something unless we love it.

Multivitamins can also be beneficial for pregnant women to support the development of the baby.&nbsp;</p><p id=evRLIMd1mb data-wc=64>"As we get older, our bodies change and may need more vitamins and minerals, and it's not uncommon for older adults to benefit from taking multivitamins. Athletes and people with very active lifestyles may also find multivitamins helpful to meet their increased nutritional needs. If you often feel tired or have trouble getting through the day, multivitamins can provide the extra support you need."</p><h2 dir=ltr>What should you look for in a multivitamin?</h2><p id=eBnj2x3nLg data-wc=36>Dr Vijay says: "While selecting a multivitamin, it's crucial to adopt a discerning approach to ensure you're investing in a product that truly benefits your health." Here are his tips for what to prioritise and avoid:</p><ul><li><strong>Comprehensive nutrient profile:</strong> Look for multivitamins that provide a wide array of vitamins and minerals, covering essential nutrients your body needs for optimal functioning. Be wary of supplements that skimp on certain nutrients or offer excessively high doses of others, as an imbalance can be detrimental to health.</li><li><strong>Bioavailability:</strong> Opt for multivitamins containing nutrients in bioavailable forms that the body can readily absorb and utilise. Avoid supplements with cheap, synthetic forms of vitamins and minerals, as they may not be as effective and could even cause imbalances in the body.</li><li><strong>Third-party testing:</strong> Choose multivitamins from brands that undergo rigorous third-party testing to ensure product quality, purity and potency. This step is crucial for verifying the accuracy of ingredient labels and confirming that the supplement is free from contaminants such as heavy metals or harmful additives.</li><li><strong>Avoid binders and fillers:</strong> Read the ingredient list carefully and steer clear of multivitamins containing unnecessary fillers, binders or artificial additives. These additives serve no nutritional purpose and may even pose health risks or trigger allergies in sensitive individuals.</li><li><strong>Check for quality certifications:</strong> Look for multivitamins that carry certifications from reputable organisations, such as NSF International or the USP Verified Mark. These certifications indicate that the product has undergone thorough testing and meets high standards of quality and safety.</li><li><strong>Research the brand’s reputation:&nbsp;</strong>Take the time to research the reputation of the brand manufacturing the multivitamin. Look for companies with a track record of producing high-quality supplements backed by scientific research and transparency in their manufacturing processes.</li><li><strong>Beware of overhyped claims:</strong> Be cautious of multivitamins that make exaggerated or unsubstantiated health claims. Remember that supplements are meant to complement a healthy diet, not replace it, and no single supplement can cure all ailments or guarantee optimal health.</li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>When and how should you take your multivitamin?</h2><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Consistency is key:</strong> "Taking your multivitamin regularly, preferably at the same time each day, helps maintain steady nutrient levels in your body," says Dr Vijay. "This consistency supports overall health and ensures you're getting the most out of your supplement. Just like sticking to a daily routine helps keep your life organised, consistent multivitamin intake ensures your body receives essential nutrients consistently, promoting optimal health and wellbeing."</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Take with meals for better absorption:&nbsp;</strong>"This helps your body absorb the nutrients better and can prevent stomach upset;" says Riya. "Breakfast is often the easiest time to remember to take your supplement since it can become a part of your daily routine. For optimal absorption, consider taking your multivitamin with a meal that contains some healthy fats. Vitamins like A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, meaning they need fats for proper absorption. A breakfast including avocado, nuts, or yoghurt can be an excellent choice." Dr Vijay adds: "Imagine your body as a sponge soaking up nutrients from the food you eat. Taking your multivitamin with meals is like squeezing that sponge, allowing it to absorb more nutrients efficiently."</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Follow recommended dosage guidelines:</strong> "Stick to the recommended dosage indicated on the label of your multivitamin. Avoid taking more than the recommended amount, as excessive intake of certain vitamins and minerals can have negative effects on your health," advises Dr Vijay.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Consult your healthcare provider:</strong>&nbsp; "If you’re taking other medications or supplements, it’s wise to consult with your healthcare provider to avoid any potential interactions," advises Riya - and Dr Vijay agrees, adding: "If you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications, it's essential to consult with healthcare professionals before starting any new supplement regimen. They can provide personalised advice tailored to your specific needs and circumstances."</li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Meet the experts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84edf07ce3de-dr-vijay.jpg><p id=e2H0r-vNDVcn data-wc=78>A trailblazer in integrating Functional Medicine and Ayurveda, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Vijay Murthy</a> has over three decades of clinical experience.
