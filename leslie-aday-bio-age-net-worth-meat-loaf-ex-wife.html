We learned that he was married to his second wife <a href=#>Deborah Gillespie</a>. But who was his first wife? How did they meet? When did they tie the knots? Did they have any kids?</p><p>We address it all in this Leslie Aday Bio. Scroll down to learn more about Meat Loaf’s ex-wife.</p><h3><strong>Meet Leslie Aday, Meat Loaf Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p>Leslie Aday was the ex-wife of Meat Loaf. He met Leslie in upstate New York where she was working as a secretary at Bearsville Records’ recording studio on 1 February 1979. According to Todd Rundgren, Meat Loaf fell for him instantaneously. Instead of taking the traditional route of asking Leslie out to dinner, Loaf made what Todd called “his first big move” in the Bear Cafe.</p><p>As Todd recalled, Meat Loaf had a package that he had brought up from New York and presented it to her. And inside the package was a big salmon. They considered the present as an engagement proposal but instead of a ring, he presented her with a salmon.</p><p>As reported in “Everything Louder Than Everything Else: Meat Loaf Guide” Leslie and Meat Loaf tied knots within a month.</p><p>Meat Loaf and Leslie Aday married on 23 February 1979, just 22 days after their first meeting.</p><p>While the engagement was certainly unconventional, their wedding was as almost wild as his proposal to Leslie. The wedding happened at Todd’s house with the ceremony performed by a priest who, according to Rundgren, “was so old that he couldn’t tell the difference between them. So he looked at Leslie and said ‘Do you Marvin, take Leslie as your lawful wedded wife?'”</p><p>The wedding took place in 1978. They stayed married till 2001. Their marriage started to fall apart in the late-1990s after Meat Loaf achieved huge success with the single I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That). Leslie blames their wealth and what she calls ‘fameosity’ for starting to pull them apart.</p><p>Leslie added: “When a male mid-life crisis meets female menopause, it’s a train wreck. And it was a big train wreck”’</p><p>But Leslie has her side of the story to share with the world many might not know. Even to this day, she has shared on her Facebook, a pic of Jimi Hendrix talking to her during his tour. Yes, Meat Loaf wasn’t the only larger-than-life celebrity she had attracted.</p><p>During the 60s when British celebrity photographer Terry O’Neill wanted photographs of Mick Jagger and his band, one 18-year-old naked girl was sitting in front of fully clothed men. She was identified as ‘Angel’ then who turned out to be Leslie Aday. <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> did a whole article on her.</p><p>Her history included flings with Mick Jagger (she was dating at the time) and <a href=#>Jimi Hendrix</a>. As for Jimi Hendrix fling, he came to perform at the 1969 rock festival at Woodstock, where she was living. She says she began cooking for him and their relationship moved from the kitchen to the bedroom.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Leslie Aday And Meat Loaf Have?</strong></h3><p>Meat Loaf adopted his new wife’s daughter, Pearl Aday, who she had in 1975 allegedly with the unnamed drummer of Janis Joplin’s group. The only thing that’s known about Pearl’s father was he was a Yankee fan and a serious softball player in several New York City’s Central Park Leagues. He told a reporter, “I don’t care if it’s a boy or a girl as long as it’s a shortstop.”</p><p>Talking about her father, Pearl shared, “My biological father played drums in her Full Tilt Boogie Band, and I’m named after her (Janis Joplin) because Pearl was her nickname. She was an incredible vocalist and a huge influence.”</p><p>Pearl shared, “When I was a baby, my mom, [Leslie Aday], would take me to the studio and I would nap in an open guitar case with pillows and a blanket”. She added, “When I grew up, there was music everywhere, whether it was at a party in the house or in someplace where my dad was performing in front of thousands of people. I really kind of grew up in recording studios. They’re relaxing to me. Even to this day, they can be blasting music and I can fall asleep on the couch because it feels like home.”</p><p>Pearl is now a musician but started her career as a backup singer for her father Meat Loaf from 1994 to 2003. She released her debut album “Little Immaculate White Fox” which was recorded at Grand Master Studios in Los Angeles. Pearl graduated from Long Ridge Elementary School in Stamford.</p><p>She attended Joel Barlow High School in Redding. Pearl is currently married to Scott Ian.</p><p>On January 21, 1981, Leslie and Meat Loaf welcomed their daughter Amanda Gray. Her sister is an actress. Some of her works are Meat Loaf: To Hell and Back, Carnivàle, Pledge This!, Restoration Dogs, Rizzoli & Isles, Madtown, and South Dakota among others.</p><h3><strong>Leslie Aday Age</strong></h3><p>Leslie Day was born on 21 May 1951. Therefore, she must be 70 years old as of Jan 2022.</p><h3><strong>What Does Leslie Aday Do For A Living?</strong></h3><p>Leslie had moved from California to New York earlier in 1969 to work as a nanny. She found herself on the street and she was offered a roof over her head at the Stones’ mansion which was owned by legendary singer Stephen Stills. The stones management struggled to find staff to administer to the band’s peculiar up-all-night needs and that’s when Leslie came in.</p><p>Leslie explained, “Someone would be hired but then they’d complain, saying, “We won’t make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at three o’clock in the morning”. But that was OK by me.”</p><p>On the morning of the photoshoot, Leslie recalled getting up early to prepare breakfast then going for a swim. She jumped in naked. When she realized a photoshoot was about to take place, she thought to herself: ‘I’d better get a towel.’ As she flitted past, naked, Jagger suggested she might want to join them.</p><p>The photo was released, but Leslie didn’t know the band back then because they weren’t “Beatles” she jokingly revealed to Daily Mail. She had a fling with Mick for a few weeks, both moved on, and Leslie moved back to her Pennsylvania home in December 1969. In 1977, she met Mick Jagger again. She was assistant manager of the Bearsville Recording Studio — set up by Bob Dylan’s manager — where the Stones came to rehearse for a tour.</p><p>Her Facebook revealed, that Leslie formerly worked for Meat Loaf as Asst Manager from 1979 to 2004. She worked at Bearsville Sound Studio as assistant manager from June 21, 1968 – February 23, 1979. She also has an <a href=#>IMDB page</a>.</p><h3><strong>Leslie Aday Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Lesli Aday’s net worth should be under $500 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Is Leslie Aday On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No Leslie Aday isn’t on Instagram but Facebook.
