The actress has won victory over three different cancers in the past, and recently, she revealed she had been diagnosed with yet another type of the illness. Despite her diagnosis, Fonda is finding a silver lining behind it. Here are the details.</p><p class=dh>Glamour and grace have never looked so amazing; at 84, American Actress, Activist, and Former Fashion Model Jane Fonda looks better than ever. However, all is not well with the icon healthwise, as she recently made quite a shocking revelation.</p><p class=dh>On September 2, 2022, Fonda took to Instagram to announce that she had been diagnosed with a type of cancer known as non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e87cd83f849d6b10abab8019eac085bc.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jane Fonda attends the Los Angeles Special FYC Event For Netflix's "Grace And Frankie" at NeueHouse Los Angeles on April 23, 2022, in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The "Barefoot In The Park" actress said she had started chemotherapy treatments and was handling everything well. In her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiBDKLeJBy_/?hl=en">words</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I'm doing chemo for six months, and [I'm] handling the treatments quite well."</p><p class=dh>In addition, Fonda wrote that she would not let her current health situation interfere with her climate activism. The Hollywood icon has been devoted to activism throughout her career, hence her assuring statement.</p><p class=dh>Also, like many others who tend to learn a thing or two from tough times, the former fashion model confessed that her cancer diagnosis taught her some important lessons.</p><p class=dh>According to the actress, Cancer has taught her the importance of community. Fonda said she had learned the importance of growing and deepening one's community to prevent being alone.</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, the entertainment star relayed that the illness has taught her the need to adapt to new realities. While many consider a cancer diagnosis a death sentence, Fonda finds a silver lining in her situation. Here is more information about the climate activist's illness and personal life.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Fonda's Optimism, Amidst Her Cancer Diagnosis</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Undoubtedly, Fonda's illness is not one to be taken lightly. However, there seems to be nothing to worry about, as the actress gave her fans hope.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Fonda's revelation about her skin and breast cancer came about a year after she confessed that she had undergone surgery for another type of cancer.</strong></h3><p class=dh>In the Instagram statement, she mentioned that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a very treatable type of cancer, adding that there is a high survival rate. Fonda <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiBDKLeJBy_/?hl=en">explained</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This is a very treatable cancer. 80% of people survive, so I feel very lucky."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e135f1ae181d4640987dac31c98ee05c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jane Fonda attends TCM Honors Actress Lily Tomlin With Hand And Footprint Ceremony at TCL Chinese Theatre on April 22, 2022, in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, the activist mentioned that her health insurance and access to the best doctors and treatments were other reasons she felt lucky. However, Fonda noted it was painful to get such privileges.</p><p class=dh>According to the icon, many American families had had to deal with cancer, and many did not have access to her amazing healthcare, which was not right.</p><p class=dh>Besides buttressing health care, Fonda also raised awareness on things that could cause cancer to eliminate them. Seeing Fonda being quite knowledgeable about cancer-related topics is not surprising, as the actress has previously touched on the subject of having numerous cancers.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Inside Fonda's Battle with Other Forms of Cancer</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Fonda's non-Hodgkin's diagnosis will not be the first time the "Grace and Frankie" star is battling cancer. Frankie has undergone treatment for at least three different forms of cancer in her lifetime. During an interview in 2019, she spoke candidly about her health struggles. In Fonda's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/health/jane-fonda-says-she-s-had-lot-cancer-throughout-her-t151508>words</a> (via Today):</p><p class=dh>"I've had a lot of cancer. I was a sun worshipper. When I have a day off, a surgeon frequently visits my skin doctor and has things cut off me."</p><p class=dh>Besides battling skin cancer, Fonda also made it known that she had undergone surgery for breast cancer. According to the former model, it happened before she attended the 2016 Golden Globes as a best-supporting actress nominee.</p><p class=dh>Fonda recalled coming out of the car in a strange white dress with multiple ruffles. The actress revealed that her outfit choice was because she had just had a mastectomy and had to cover the bandages.</p><p class=dh>Fonda's revelation about her skin and breast cancer came about a year after she confessed that she had undergone surgery for another type of cancer.</p><p class=dh>During a chat with Today in 2018, the Hollywood star noted that she had a cancerous growth removed from her lip. Through all the health challenges, Fonda has proven to be a survivor.</p><p class=dh>However, since her previous cancer diagnosis, the actress's health has been in an ongoing process. Hopefully, she will pull through her current illness.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Aging, an Inevitable Part of Life</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Over the years, Fonda has shared that exercise and yoga are the most important tips for staying healthy and in good shape. About four decades ago, the star released her workout album with songs from top musical legends, including The Jacksons and Quincy Jones.</p><p class=dh>She noted during a July 2022 interview that it all began after she took a class with Exercise Instructor Leni Cazden. According to Fonda, she contacted musicians asking for songs for the workout videos, to which they agreed. After launching the workout videos, they became a big hit.</p><p class=dh>However, many years later, she is starting to feel her age. During her July 2022 appearance on "The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon," Fonda confessed that due to her age, there was no slow song enough for her to do a workout. Fonda <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1642821/Jane-Fonda-age-health-struggle-fitness>noted</a> (via Express):</p><p class=dh>"I'm almost 85 years old; you can't move fast."</p><p class=dh>Not only did the actress reveal that she could no longer move fast, but she also mentioned that she was surprised to experience aches all over her body. Fonda explained that it was not a result of all the working out she did but because it was genetic.</p><p class=dh>Nevertheless, despite how mother time has slowed her down, Fonda said she feels blessed to have lived this long. In the icon's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/health/jane-fonda-says-she-s-had-lot-cancer-throughout-her-t151508>words</a> (via Today):</p><p class=dh>"I didn't think I'd ever live this long – or feel that I'm whole or getting whole. I feel very intentional about realizing that it's up to me how this last part of my life goes."</p><p class=dh>No matter how weak <a class="me a" href=#>Fonda</a> may have gotten due to her age, she will always remain an inspiration to her fans and many other fitness enthusiasts worldwide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbWxoaHqrrc2eZJ%2BnnpmubrLEnqOsZaaav7p5y66apLFdmK6vr8SrZJqmnqTCb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f294483-jane-fonda-feels-very-lucky-cancer-annou-html.html&text=Jane%20Fonda%20Feels%20%27Very%20Lucky%27%20Following%20Cancer%20Reveal%20after%20Sharing%20She%20%27Can%27t%20Move%20Fast%27%20Anymore%20Du&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f294483-jane-fonda-feels-very-lucky-cancer-annou-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f294483-jane-fonda-feels-very-lucky-cancer-annou-html.html&title=Jane%20Fonda%20Feels%20%27Very%20Lucky%27%20Following%20Cancer%20Reveal%20after%20Sharing%20She%20%27Can%27t%20Move%20Fast%27%20Anymore%20Du" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f294483-jane-fonda-feels-very-lucky-cancer-annou-html.html&title=Jane%20Fonda%20Feels%20%27Very%20Lucky%27%20Following%20Cancer%20Reveal%20after%20Sharing%20She%20%27Can%27t%20Move%20Fast%27%20Anymore%20Du" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f294483-jane-fonda-feels-very-lucky-cancer-annou-html.html&title=Jane%20Fonda%20Feels%20%27Very%20Lucky%27%20Following%20Cancer%20Reveal%20after%20Sharing%20She%20%27Can%27t%20Move%20Fast%27%20Anymore%20Du" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f294483-jane-fonda-feels-very-lucky-cancer-annou-html.html&description=Jane%20Fonda%20Feels%20%27Very%20Lucky%27%20Following%20Cancer%20Reveal%20after%20Sharing%20She%20%27Can%27t%20Move%20Fast%27%20Anymore%20Du" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jhanvi-kapoor-net-worth-155812.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jhanvi Kapoor Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./arctic-cooling-accelero-hybrid-vga-cooler-review-not-for-the-faint-of-heart.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Installation, Part 2 - Arctic Cooling Accelero Hybrid VGA Cooler Review: Not For the Faint of Heart">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
